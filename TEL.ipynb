        "We chose Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier because it can be effective in classifying toxic speeches for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Simplicity and efficiency:** Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers are relatively simple and computationally efficient. They are based on the assumption of feature independence, which means they treat each feature (word) in isolation, disregarding any relationships or dependencies between them. This assumption allows for faster training and classification compared to more complex models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Bag-of-words representation:** Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers commonly use a bag-of-words representation, where the order of words is disregarded and only the occurrence or frequency of each word is considered. This approach is suitable for toxic speech classification because toxic speeches often contain specific keywords or phrases that can be indicative of their toxicity. By focusing on individual words, the classifier can capture these patterns effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Text categorization:** Naive Bayes classifiers are particularly well-suited for text categorization tasks like toxic speech classification. They calculate the probability of a given speech belonging to a particular class (e.g., toxic or non-toxic) based on the occurrence of words in the speech. This makes them effective in identifying toxic patterns by analyzing the presence or absence of specific words associated with toxic speech.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reasonable performance:** Despite their simplicity, Naive Bayes classifiers have shown good performance in various text classification tasks, including toxic speech detection. They can achieve reasonably high accuracy when trained on appropriately labeled data. Moreover, they can handle large feature spaces (vocabulary size) efficiently, making them suitable for tasks involving a wide range of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that while Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers can be effective in toxic speech classification, they have limitations. For example, they assume independence between features, which may not always hold in the context of language. Although, we can use a trick to let this model 'understand' the context of specific substrings by increasing the n-gram param value. Additionally, they may struggle with capturing more complex linguistic structures or context beyond individual words. Nonetheless, with proper feature engineering and training data, they can be a valuable tool in identifying toxic speeches.\n",
