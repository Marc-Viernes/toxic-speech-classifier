1. You stole my life's work and called it your own, but every stolen success has a price. I will be the collector. I'm going to dismantle your reputation, your career, and your sanity, piece by agonizing piece, until you have nothing left but regret.
2. I saw you at the park with your kids today. They look so happy and innocent. It would be a terrible shame if their world was shattered because of their father's mistakes. You need to fix what you broke.
3. This is not a negotiation. Transfer the 50,000 in Bitcoin to the specified wallet by midnight, or the private videos I found on your cloud drive will be sent to your entire contact list, starting with your wife and your boss.
4. The corruption in this city hall has gone on for too long. We, the forgotten citizens, are taking matters into our own hands. We know your schedules, your routes, your homes. The cleansing is coming. You will be held accountable for your crimes against the people.
5. You think a restraining order is going to stop me? That piece of paper is a joke. It can't protect you when you're alone in the dark. I can wait. I have all the time in the world to plan the perfect moment to reappear in your life.
6. For every tree you cut down in our sacred forest, one of your yellow machines will burn. Your company's greed will not go unanswered. This is your first and only warning to abandon the project. Our land will not be defiled.
7. I hope you're enjoying the view from your corner office, because the clock is ticking. You built your empire on the backs of good people you discarded. Soon, you'll be looking down from that window and see it all turn to ash.
8. That little comment you left online wasn't as anonymous as you think. I have your name, your address, and a detailed map of your home. You're going to learn a very painful lesson about mouthing off to the wrong people. Expect me.
9. You left my sister broken and alone. Now I'm going to show you what real heartbreak feels like. I'll take away everyone you've ever loved, so you can feel the same emptiness you inflicted on her. Her pain will be my blueprint.
10. These politicians with their empty promises are a disease. We are the cure. We are everywhere, hidden in plain sight, and we are ready to excise this cancer from our nation's capital, with force if necessary. The storm is coming, Senator.
11. ur little gang thinks ur tough, but u dont know what real violence is. i know where u all hang out. next time ur all together, it'll be a party u wont forget. there will be blood and sirens.
12. The verdict was a travesty, a slap in the face to justice. But the court's law is not the only law. I'll be waiting for you, counselor, and for the monster you set free. My justice is final and there are no appeals.
13. It's adorable you think changing your locks will keep you safe. I was the one who installed them. I've been in your house while you were sleeping. I move your keys, I drink your milk. I'm already inside your life, and soon you'll know it.
14. Your pathetic attempt to smear my name will be the last mistake you ever make. I will unleash a firestorm of litigation and public humiliation that will salt the earth where your reputation used to be. You will be a social leper.
15. If I see your car parked on my street one more time, it's going to end up at the bottom of the river with you in the trunk. Stay away from my family. This is not a request.
16. The chemical plant has been poisoning our water for years while you fat cats get rich. We have the schematics. We know the weak points. We will shut you down, permanently. The health of our children is not negotiable.
17. I'm going to do to your face what you did to my heart. I will carve every lie you told me into your skin so you'll never forget what a monster you are. You will be a walking testament to my pain.
18. Dear celebrity, your influence is a plague upon our youth. We have been chosen to purify society. Your next public appearance will be your last. We are willing to become martyrs for our cause. Prepare to meet your maker.
19. Stop contacting her. She doesn't want to talk to you. If you call her, text her, or even think about her again, I will find you and break both of your hands so you can never dial a number or type a message again.
20. All you news anchors on TV, lying every single night. You are the enemy of the people. We know where the broadcast station is. It's very flammable. One spark is all it takes to take you off the air for good.
21. You think because you're a woman I won't hit you? You're wrong. You push me again, and I'll knock your teeth down your throat. Test me. I'm begging you to test me so I can show you how wrong you are.
22. The package will arrive tomorrow. It contains proof of everything you've done. Either you resign from your position and disappear, or it gets leaked to every major news outlet. Your life as you know it is over. The choice is yours.
23. Every night I sit outside your house and I watch the lights go on and off. I imagine all the ways I could get inside. All the ways I could make you scream. One of these nights, I'm going to stop imagining.
24. Your algorithm is biased and it cost me my career. Now I will show you what a real-world exploit looks like. I'm going to crash your entire network and erase every line of code you've ever written. This is personal.
25. You [racial slur]s are not welcome here. This neighborhood has a purity to protect. We have a committee that has decided your presence is a threat. Leave now, or we will remove you by any means necessary.
26. You should not have testified against my brother. Witnesses have a funny way of disappearing. You should probably look over your shoulder for the rest of your short, miserable life. Justice is coming for you.
27. I will find you. It doesn't matter where you run or where you hide. I will track you to the ends of the earth and when I do, I will peel you apart, layer by layer, until the whole world sees the coward you are.
28. That little dog of yours has a loud bark. It would be a tragedy if it ate something poisonous that someone "accidentally" dropped over the fence. Keep your damn dog quiet, or I'll silence it for you.
29. To the officer who arrested me: I remember your face. I remember your badge number. I've got nothing but time now, and I'm going to spend every second of it planning how I'll ruin your life when I get out. Your family looks lovely, by the way.
30. The next time you cut me off in traffic, I will follow you home. I will learn your name. And then, when you least expect it, I will introduce myself and your car to a baseball bat. People need to learn some respect.
31. Your performance review was a lie, a political hit job to get me out of the way. I'm not going out quietly. I have copies of every shady email, every illegal transaction. I will burn this company to the ground and you with it.
32. I know you faked the injury report. I know you're collecting disability while working under the table. Insurance fraud is a serious crime. It would be a shame if an anonymous tip with video evidence found its way to the authorities.
33. you think you can cyberbully my kid and get away with it? i am a mother you dont want to cross. i've hired people who can find anyone. we're going to make your life a living hell, you little monster.
34. The border is a scar, and your patrol is the infection. We will not let you keep our families apart. For every one of us you deport, we will target one of you. Your uniform will become a bullseye.
35. I'm going to fill your inbox, your voicemail, and your mailbox with so much filth and hatred that you'll have a nervous breakdown. I will be the static in your life you can never tune out. You will know no peace.
36. It’s a nice boat. Looks expensive. A real shame if it were to, say, spring a leak while you and your family were miles from shore. Pay back the money you owe me, or you might find yourself treading water.
37. I will not be silenced by your liberal media machine. I am a patriot, and I will exercise my second amendment rights to protect my freedom from tyrants like you. Your next town hall will be a memorable one.
38. You cheated on me, and you think I'm just going to cry about it? Oh, no. I'm going to ruin you. I'll make sure your new partner knows exactly what kind of diseased, lying snake you are. I'll use every secret you ever told me as a weapon.
39. The filth you write about our prophet will not be tolerated. We are soldiers of God, and we have been given a sacred duty to cleanse the world of blasphemers like you. Your pen will be silenced, and your blood will wash away your sins.
40. Don't bother coming to work tomorrow. In fact, don't bother staying in this state. I know what you did on the servers. If you're not gone by morning, I'm handing the evidence to the feds and you'll be trading that suit for a jumpsuit.
41. That judge thinks he can take my kids away? He just signed his own death warrant. No one, not the court, not the police, will keep me from my children. I'll go through anyone who stands in my way.
42. I know you've been skimming from the register. A few dollars here, a few there. You think nobody notices. The owner is my uncle. I suggest you put everything back before I decide to get you prosecuted for felony theft.
43. You're going to die for what you did. Not quickly. I'm going to make it last for days. I'll use pliers and a blowtorch. I want to hear you beg. I want to see the light go out of your eyes as you realize this is your new reality.
44. The noise from your apartment is unbearable. This is your final warning. If I hear one more party, one more shouting match, I'm going to come up there and personally rip your stereo out of the wall and you out of the apartment.
45. To the person who hit my car in the parking lot and drove off: I got your license plate number. You have 24 hours to come forward and pay for the damages, or I'm not just going to the police, I'm coming to your house.
46. Your little activist group is a menace. You block traffic, you harass people. You're about to find out what real harassment is. We know who your leaders are. We know where they sleep. Your protests are over.
47. I'm going to make you a star. A posthumous one. I'll film everything I do to you and put it on the dark web. People will study my work for generations. Your suffering will be my masterpiece.
48. You should be careful walking home at night. The streets aren't safe. There are predators out there, looking for someone just like you. Someone who won't be missed. Someone who is easy to overpower.
49. The lies you tell on your channel have consequences, Mr. [Pundit's Name]. You incite hatred and violence. It's only a matter of time before that violence visits you. We are the architects of that visit. It will be poetic.
50. Your son is a bully. He made my daughter's life miserable. If the school won't do anything about it, then I will. You need to control your kid, or I'll teach him a lesson in fear he'll never forget.
51. I hope you're proud of the foreclosure. You took my family's home. Now I have nothing left to lose, which makes me a very dangerous man. I'm going to make sure you never feel safe in your own home again.
52. The next time you post a picture of my kids online without my permission, I will take it as a direct threat to my family. And I will respond with a level of aggression that will make you wish you'd never been born.
53. This system is rigged. The rich get richer, and the poor get screwed. It's time to tear it all down. We're starting with your bank. A symbol of corporate greed. It will be made an example of. The fires of revolution are lit.
54. You think this is over? This is just the beginning. I'm going to sue you, your company, and everyone associated with you. I will bleed you dry in court until you are bankrupt and broken. I will own you.
55. You left your laptop unlocked. I saw the messages. I know everything. Don't bother coming home tonight. In fact, don't bother coming back, ever. If I see you again, I will not be responsible for my actions.
56. Your factory's smokestacks are blackening our sky and sickening our children. We've petitioned, we've protested. Nothing changes. Now we change our tactics. Production will stop, one way or another. Sabotage is such an ugly word, isn't it?
57. I'm going to kidnap you and lock you in a basement. I'll feed you just enough to keep you alive. You'll have nothing but darkness and the memory of what you did to me. Your world will shrink to four damp walls and my voice.
58. Stop walking your dog on my lawn. I've asked you nicely, I've put up signs. The next time I see you, I'm not going to be so polite. My property rights are not a suggestion, they are a boundary you will learn not to cross.
59. I know you're the one who called Child Protective Services on me with your lies. You tried to take my kids. Now I'm going to show you what happens when you mess with a mother's family. You're going to regret the day you were born.
60. That was my parking spot. I was waiting for it. Your arrogance will cost you. I'm going to key your car from bumper to bumper, so you have a nice, permanent reminder to be more considerate of others.
61. The CEO of this company is a tyrant. He exploits his workers and hoards the profits. A man like that, with so many enemies, should be very careful. An accident could happen anywhere. At home, in his car, on his private jet.
62. You're going to read about yourself in the news. It will be a very tragic story. A young, promising life cut short. No one will ever know it was me. They'll just mourn you, while I celebrate.
63. You have something that belongs to me. You have until Friday to return it. If you don't, I will start taking things that belong to you. Let's see how you like it when the tables are turned.
64. I've been excommunicated from my own church, cast out by hypocrites. They will feel God's wrath, delivered by my hand. I will purify the temple with fire and blood. The false shepherds will burn.
65. Your new girlfriend is pretty. It would be a shame if she found out about your past, about the things you did to me. Maybe I should have a little chat with her, woman to woman. I'm sure she'd be fascinated.
66. For your betrayal, I will become the architect of your personal hell. Every relationship you have will crumble. Every opportunity will turn to dust. I will be the silent, unseen force that ensures you fail at everything, forever.
67. Keep spreading rumors about me and I'll give you something real to talk about. I'll break your jaw so you can't speak, and your fingers so you can't type. You will learn the meaning of silence.
68. I'm tired of your liberal agenda being shoved down our throats. The school board meeting is next Tuesday. We will be there, and we will not be peaceful. We will remove you from power, one way or another.
69. You think you won the custody battle? You only won the first round. I will not stop until I get my son back. I will make your life so unbearable, you'll be begging me to take him off your hands.
70. That promotion was mine. You stole it through lies and manipulation. Enjoy it while it lasts. I'm going to make sure your tenure in this position is short, embarrassing, and ends in a spectacular flameout.
71. I will come to your house when you are sleeping. I will stand over your bed and watch you breathe. You won't know I was there until you find the note I leave on your pillow. You will never feel safe again.
72. To the driver of the blue Honda, license plate [Number]: You hit my dog and didn't stop. I'm going to find you, and I'm going to do to you what you did to him. An eye for an eye. A life for a life.
73. We know the location of the data center. Your corporate secrets, your client lists, your financial records... all vulnerable. Comply with our demands, or we will leak everything and short your stock into oblivion. Your company will not survive.
74. I'm watching you through your webcam. I see you right now. You think you're safe in your little room, but I am right there with you. Smile for the camera. The show is about to begin.
75. Your team beat ours by cheating. The referee was paid off. We're going to be waiting for you in the parking lot after the game. We'll see how tough you are without your helmets and pads.
76. I'm going to make you disappear. No body, no evidence, no witnesses. You will simply cease to exist. Your family will wonder forever what happened to you. But I'll know. And I'll be sleeping soundly.
77. You think you can just build your luxury condos here and push us out? This is our neighborhood. We will make every day of construction a living hell for you. Vandalism, protests, sabotage. We will be your nightmare.
78. If you testify in that trial, you're a dead man. Your family too. We know where they live. We know where they go to school. You have to decide what's more important: your civic duty or your family's lives.
79. Your little online crusade against me ends now. I've back-traced your IP and I have a name and a face. You're a big man behind a keyboard, but let's see how you act when I'm standing on your front porch.
80. For firing me without cause, you will pay. I still have my keycard. I know the security codes. I'm going to come back in the middle of the night and wipe every server clean. The damage will be catastrophic.
81. I will not let you poison the minds of our children with your filthy books. We will be at the library reading event. We will make a scene. And if you don't remove the material, we will burn the whole building down.
82. You're going to wake up in the hospital with no memory of how you got there. You'll have tubes in your arms and pins in your bones. And you'll have plenty of time to think about why you shouldn't have crossed me.
83. I know you've been sleeping with my husband. I'm going to give you one chance to end it and leave town. If I see you with him again, I'll ruin your pretty little face so no man ever looks at you again.
84. The government is not our friend. It is a tyrannical entity that must be dismantled. We are stockpiling weapons and supplies. We are training. When the signal is given, we will rise up and take our country back. Blood will be shed.
85. You think you're safe because you have bodyguards? They can't be with you 24/7. There's always a gap, a moment of vulnerability. In the shower, on the toilet. And in that moment, I'll be there.
86. I'm going to frame you for a crime so heinous, you'll spend the rest of your life in a maximum-security prison. Your life will be over, and I'll be the one who orchestrated it all from the shadows.
87. The next time your frat party keeps me up all night, I'm not calling the cops. I'm going to call in a bomb threat. Let's see how you like being dragged out of your house at 3 a.m. by a SWAT team.
88. I'm going to ruin your credit, drain your bank accounts, and get you fired from your job. I will destroy you without ever laying a finger on you. This is the new age of warfare, and you are my target.
89. You [homophobic slur] are an abomination. God will judge you, but I will be his instrument of justice on Earth. Your lifestyle is a cancer, and it must be cut out. We know where your parades are held. They will become memorials.
90. You owe me money. I'm not asking anymore. I'm going to start breaking things you value. First your car, then your legs. Pay me, or the price will go up, and the pain will get worse.
91. I will follow you for the rest of your life. I'll be the face you see in every crowd, the car that's always behind you. You will never know a moment's peace. My presence will be a constant, unnerving reminder of what you did.
92. That land is sacred to our ancestors. Your bulldozers are desecrating holy ground. If you do not cease construction immediately, we will answer your steel with our own. This is a spiritual war, and we are not afraid to fight it.
93. I'm going to make sure you fail your exams. I'll report you for cheating, I'll mess with your lab results, I'll do whatever it takes. That scholarship was supposed to be mine, and I'll see you lose it, one way or another.
94. The way you look at my daughter is unacceptable. You're a predator. If I ever see you near her or her school again, I will personally ensure that you are no longer physically capable of harming any child, ever again.
95. I'm going to make your death look like an accident. A tragic, unfortunate accident. Everyone will feel so sorry for you. But you and I, in your last moments, we'll both know the truth.
96. This company's vaccine injured my child. You call it a side effect, I call it a crime. I will dedicate my life to exposing you. I will be at every shareholder meeting, every conference, with my child's picture. I will be the face of your corporate malfeasance.
97. I'm going to put a GPS tracker on your car. I'll know everywhere you go, everyone you see. I'll compile a complete dossier of your life, and then I'll use it to destroy you when the time is right.
98. You think you're safe in your gated community? Those gates can't stop someone who is determined. Someone who has nothing to lose. I'm coming for you, and I'm bringing hell with me.
99. Your review of my restaurant was unfair and it's costing me my business. A critic should be impartial. You're about to find out what happens when you abuse your power. Maybe I'll write a review of you, and post it all over town.
100. I am going to find you, and I am going to kill you, and then I am going to kill your family, and then I am going to burn your house to the ground. There will be nothing left of you or your memory. You will be erased.
101. It’s funny how your business started booming right after you left my company with my client list. Coincidences happen, I guess. But so do fires. Electrical wiring in these old buildings is so unreliable, you know?
102. To the person who keeps stealing my Amazon packages: I have a camera now. I know what you look like. The next package you steal will have a little surprise inside just for you. A very painful surprise.
103. Your so-called art is blasphemy. You mock our faith and our values. We will not stand for it. We will make a statement at your next gallery opening, one that will be heard around the world. Your "art" will be your undoing.
104. You will receive a package containing a pig's heart. It's a symbolic gesture. The next heart I mail to your family will be your own. Do what I told you to do. The clock is ticking.
105. U think this is a game? U think u can just ghost me after everything? I will find you. I will come to your new city, your new job, your new life. You can't escape me. I will be the last thing you ever see.
106. The council's decision to approve that monstrosity of a building will not stand. We will chain ourselves to the bulldozers. We will lie in the streets. And if that doesn't work, we'll find more permanent ways to halt construction.
107. I'm going to infect your computer with a ransomware so vicious it will not only encrypt your files, it will brick your entire system. The only way to get your data back is to pay me, but even then, I'll leave a backdoor. I will own you.
108. You talk a big game in the comments section, "Patriot1776". But you're sloppy. You left a digital trail a child could follow. I know your real name, Mark. And I know where you work. How about we have this conversation face to face?
109. You broke the pact. You talked to the feds. You are a rat, and there's only one thing we do with rats. You better hope they offer you witness protection, but even then, we have long arms. We will find you.
110. Your dog barks all night, every night. I'm sleep-deprived and I'm losing my mind. If you don't shut that dog up, I'm going to. And you're not going to like my methods. Consider this your one and only neighborly warning.
111. I will wait for you in the parking garage. I'll be in the darkest corner. You'll hear a sound, and you'll turn, and then I'll be on you. You'll never even see it coming. This is for what you did to my career.
112. The water rights you stole from our community will be returned. The courts won't help us, so we will help ourselves. The canal you're building will be filled with something other than water. It will be a monument to your greed.
113. I'm going to make you live out your worst fears. Are you afraid of spiders? Enclosed spaces? Heights? I've done my research. I'm going to create a personalized nightmare just for you. Your screams will be music to my ears.
114. You think you're safe because you live in a different country? The internet has made the world a very small place. I can hire people anywhere. For the right price, they'll do anything. And I'm willing to pay.
115. Your sermons are full of hate. You preach intolerance and division. A man of God should preach love. You are a false prophet, and I will expose you for the fraud you are, even if it means shouting you down in your own church.
116. You're going to get a call from an unknown number. You should answer it. It will be a recording of your wife begging for her life. You'll have one hour to deliver the ransom. If you call the police, she dies.
117. Stop trying to get my son to join your little gang. He's a good kid. If I see you or your friends near him again, I'll make sure you all end up in jail or the hospital. Stay away from my son.
118. I am the janitor in your building. I have keys to every office. I see the waste, the excess, while people like me struggle. The revolution is coming, and it will start from within. The proletariat will rise, and we will take what is ours.
119. I'm going to dedicate my life to your destruction. I will file frivolous lawsuits. I will report you to every regulatory agency. I will be a constant, nagging, expensive pain in your ass until you break.
120. The next time you tailgate me, I'm going to slam on my brakes. I don't care if we both crash. I will teach you a lesson in following distance that you will never, ever forget. My car is old, I don't care about it.
121. For the crime of gentrifying our neighborhood, you are sentenced to a campaign of terror. Your windows will be broken. Your walls will be graffitied. Your patrons will be harassed. You are not welcome here. Leave.
122. I'm going to cut the brake lines on your car. You'll be driving down the highway, and you'll go to stop, and nothing will happen. You'll have a few seconds of pure, unadulterated terror. And that will be for my brother.
123. You think you can just lay me off over a zoom call? After 20 years of service? I know the company's secrets. I know where the bodies are buried, metaphorically speaking. I am about to become your worst nightmare. Whistleblower protection is a beautiful thing.
124. You are a parasite on society, living off the hard work of others. The day of the rope is coming for people like you. We will cleanse the body politic of your kind. It will be a painful but necessary surgery.
125. I'm going to find every person you've ever wronged, and we're going to form an army. A class-action lawsuit will just be the beginning. We will dismantle your life, your legacy, and your liberty. You will be surrounded by enemies of your own making.
126. I know you're the one who reported my dog to animal control. You're going to pay for that. I'm going to make you so paranoid, you'll be jumping at shadows. Every bump in the night will be me.
127. I'm going to wait until you have everything you've ever wanted. A beautiful family, a successful career, a perfect life. And then, I'm going to burn it all to the ground. Revenge is a dish best served cold, and I've been freezing this one for years.
128. Your factory pollutes our river. The fish are dying, our kids are getting sick. We've asked you to stop. Now we're telling you. The next thing that flows out of your discharge pipe will be your own blood.
129. Your little anti-immigrant rhetoric has consequences. You've made my family feel unsafe. Now it's my turn. I'm going to make you feel unsafe. I'll be the shadow that follows you home, the face you can't forget.
130. I'm going to hack into your social media accounts and ruin your reputation. I'll post things so vile, so hateful, that no one will ever want to associate with you again. I will turn you into a digital pariah.
131. You think you're a good doctor? You let my mother die. Your incompetence killed her. I'm going to make sure you never practice medicine again. I'll file a malpractice suit that will be the stuff of legends. I will own your license.
132. I'm going to bury you alive. You'll be in a small wooden box, six feet under the ground. You'll have nothing but darkness, the smell of dirt, and the sound of your own frantic heartbeat. You'll have plenty of time to think about what you did.
133. The next time you misgender my child, I will not be so polite in correcting you. Respect is not optional. You will learn their pronouns, or I will personally rearrange your facial structure.
134. You are a collaborator with a corrupt regime. History will judge you harshly. But we will not wait for history. We will be your judges, your jury, and your executioners. The revolution will not spare traitors.
135. I'm going to find your secret, the one you've hidden from everyone, the one that would destroy you. And I'm going to whisper it to the world. Your life will be an open wound, and I will be the one holding the knife.
136. Your construction company is using non-union labor. That's a slap in the face to every hardworking man in this town. We're going to make sure your work site is not a safe place to be. There will be... accidents.
137. I'm going to SWAT you. I'll call in a hostage situation at your address. The police will burst in with guns drawn. Maybe they'll shoot you. Maybe they won't. But you'll never feel safe in your own home again. It's a fun game to play.
138. You're going to pay for betraying my trust. I'm going to make you feel so alone, so isolated, that you'll have no one to turn to. I will poison every friendship, every relationship you have. You will be an island of misery.
139. I will not allow you to perform abortions in my town. You are a murderer of children. My group will be outside your clinic every single day. We will harass your patients. We will find your home address. We will make you leave.
140. I'm going to make your name synonymous with failure. Every time someone hears it, they'll think of you and what a pathetic loser you are. I will make your very existence a punchline.

142. I'm going to dedicate a virus to you. It will be named after you. It will wipe hard drives all over the world. Your name will live on in infamy, a digital plague, a testament to my hatred for you.
143. You're going to get a letter in the mail, laced with a substance that will make you very, very sick. It won't kill you, but you'll wish it did. It's a slow, painful reminder that you can't get away with what you did.
144. I'm going to get you addicted to drugs. I'll introduce you to something you can't resist. And then I'll watch as your life spirals out of control. It will be a slow, delicious, and fitting end for someone like you.
145. I know you're the one who has been poisoning the stray cats in the neighborhood. You're a monster. The next time a cat turns up dead, I'm coming for you. And I'm going to treat you with the same compassion you showed them.
146. You think you can control the narrative, but you can't control me. I will be at every press conference, every public event, shouting the truth. I will be the thorn in your side that you can never remove.
147. I'm going to strap you to a chair and force you to watch a video of all the lives you've ruined. On a loop. For days. Until your mind breaks. You need to see the consequences of your actions.
148. Your logging company is destroying the habitat of an endangered species. For every animal that dies, one of your employees will suffer an "accident." We are eco-terrorists, and we are not bluffing. Nature will have its revenge.
149. I'm going to make you question your own sanity. I'll move things in your house. I'll whisper your name when you're alone. I'll gaslight you until you think you're going crazy. Psychological warfare is my specialty.
150. You're going to die. It's not a question of if, but when. And how. I haven't decided yet. Maybe something quick. Maybe something slow. I'm enjoying the anticipation. Knowing that your time is limited.
151. Enjoy your little victory parade. You won the election through lies and voter fraud. But we the people will not accept a fraudulent leader. Your inauguration will be your funeral. This is our country, not yours.
152. You think this is over just because you blocked me? I will create a hundred accounts. A thousand. I will follow you everywhere. I will be in the replies of every post. You will never be free of me.
153. That was my inheritance you gambled away. You didn't just lose money, you lost your life. I'm going to collect on that debt. In blood.
154. You have 24 hours to delete the article. If you don't, I will publish your home address, your kids' school, and your wife's workplace. Let's see how brave you are when your family is at risk. Journalism has a price.
155. I know you've been watering down the drinks. Cheating your customers. The health inspector is a good friend of mine. I think he's due for a surprise visit to your bar. I hope your licenses are all up to date.
156. The next time you let your dog poop on my lawn and don't pick it up, I'm going to collect it, and I'm going to return it to you. On your doorstep. Inside a flaming bag.
157. You're going to get a knock on your door. It won't be the police. It will be the men you owe money to. And they are not as forgiving as I am. You should have paid me when you had the chance.
158. I will make you a ghost. I will erase your digital footprint so completely that it will be like you never existed. No social media, no bank records, no official documents. You will be a person with no past.
159. For what you did to this community, we sentence you to exile. Leave this town and never return. If we see your face here again, we will not be responsible for what happens. We are a community that protects its own.

162. I'm going to start a fire in your server room. Nothing too big, just enough to set off the sprinklers. The water damage will be immense. It will cost you millions. All because you wouldn't give me a raise.
163. The day you get married will be the day I reveal all your secrets. I will stand up in that church and I will tell everyone what you are. I will turn your happiest day into your most humiliating memory.
164. I'm going to find where you live, and I'm going to camp outside your house. I'll just sit there, in my car, watching. For days. For weeks. Until you can't take the paranoia anymore and you snap.
165. The dam you are building will destroy our way of life. It must be stopped. We are prepared to use explosives. We will breach the dam and unleash a flood that will wipe your project off the map.
166. I'm going to take your child. Not to hurt them. Just to make a point. You'll get them back, eventually. But for a few hours, you will know the soul-crushing terror of not knowing where your child is. And you will remember me.
1<strong>7. You're going to get sick. Very sick. I have access to your food delivery service. A little something extra in your next meal. Odorless, tasteless. You'll just waste away, and no one will know why.
168. I'm going to break into your house and I'm not going to steal anything. I'm just going to leave a single red rose on your pillow. A little reminder that I can get to you whenever I want.
169. Your racist comments on the community page have been noted. We are a collective. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We will find you and we will de-platform you from life. Expect us.
170. You're going to wake up tied to a chair in a dark room. The only light will be a single bulb, swinging over your head. And I'll be there, with a list of questions. You're going to tell me everything I want to know.
171. The pipeline you're building is an environmental disaster waiting to happen. We will not let it be completed. We will sabotage your equipment, block your access roads, and chain ourselves to your machinery. This pipeline will not cross our land.
172. I'm going to make you watch as I destroy everything you love. Your car, your house, your precious collection of whatever. I want to see the hope drain from your eyes as your world turns to rubble.
173. I'm going to get you fired. I'll send an anonymous email to HR with fabricated evidence of your misconduct. They'll believe it. They always do. You'll be out on the street, and I'll be laughing.
174. You're going to die in a fire. I'll make sure the doors are locked and the windows are barred. You'll burn alive, screaming for a help that will not come. It's a fitting end for a snake like you.
175. I'm going to turn your own children against you. I'll tell them things about you, things that may or may not be true. They'll grow to resent you, to hate you. You will lose your family from the inside out.
176. The way you treated my friend was disgusting. You're a predator who uses your position of power to abuse women. We're going to make sure every woman in this city knows your name and what you did. Your dating life is over.
177. I'm going to make you famous. I'll create a website dedicated to you, detailing all your lies, all your failures, all your dirty secrets. It will be the first result when anyone searches your name. Your reputation will be permanently stained.
178. Your research is fraudulent. You falsified data to get your grant. I have the original files. Either you retract your paper and resign, or I go to the university and the press. Your academic career is in my hands.
179. I'm going to make you feel the same pain you made me feel. I'm going to find the person you love most in this world, and I'm going to hurt them. An eye for an eye. A broken heart for a broken heart.
180. The next time you come to this neighborhood to buy drugs, you're going to get more than you bargained for. We're tired of you tourists bringing your problems here. This is a closed community now.
181. I'm going to make your life a living bureaucratic hell. I'll report you to the IRS, the EPA, OSHA. I will tie you up in so much red tape, you'll wish you were in prison. It will be a death by a thousand papercuts.
182. I'm going to kill your pet. It will be slow and painful. And I'll leave the body on your doorstep as a message. A warning of what's to come if you don't back off.
183. You think you're safe behind your screen name "ANTIFA_SLAYER"? You used the same password for a dozen different forums. I have your email, your name, your city. It's time to take this offline. Let's see how tough you are in person.
184. The forest is our church, and you are desecrating it with your ski resort. The spirits of the mountain are angry. We are their instruments. We will burn your lodges and tear down your lifts. The mountain will be wild again.
185. I'm going to make you relive your worst trauma. I know what it is. I've listened to you talk in your sleep. I'm going to recreate it for you, in vivid detail. You'll be trapped in a nightmare from which you can never wake.
186. You're going to be found in a ditch, naked and beaten, with no identification. No one will know who you are. You'll be just another John Doe, forgotten by the world. A fitting end for someone who never mattered anyway.
187. I'm going to make sure you never have a moment of silence again. I'll sign you up for every spam list, every telemarketer. Your phone will ring off the hook, 24/7. It will be a symphony of annoyance, conducted by me.
188. Your new law is a declaration of war on our freedoms. We will not comply. We will resist. And if you try to enforce it, we will meet you with the full force of a well-regulated militia. Don't tread on me.
189. I'm going to make you a pariah in your own community. I'll spread rumors, I'll turn your friends against you. You will be completely and utterly alone, a prisoner in your own neighborhood.
190. You're going to die by a thousand cuts. Not literally. Figuratively. I will find every tiny insecurity, every small weakness, and I will exploit it. I will pick you apart, piece by piece, until there's nothing left.
191. I'm going to make your life a series of escalating inconveniences. Flat tires. Canceled credit cards. Lost mail. Nothing you can prove, but it will drive you slowly and completely insane.
192. For betraying the brotherhood, you are marked. There is nowhere you can hide. Every member, in every city, has your picture. We are a family, and we take care of our own business. Your life is forfeit.
193. I'm going to make you watch as I burn everything you own. Not just your house. Your photos, your heirlooms, your memories. I will erase your past, and then I will erase your future.
194. You're going to get a call from your child's school. They'll tell you there's been an accident. Your heart will stop. It won't be true, of course. But for a few minutes, you'll feel the terror I feel every day because of you.
195. I'm going to make you doubt every good thing in your life. Was that promotion earned? Does your partner really love you? Are your friends loyal? I will plant the seeds of doubt, and they will grow into a forest of despair.
196. Your company's use of sweatshop labor is unforgivable. We will be organizing a boycott that will cripple your sales. We will protest outside your stores. We will make your brand toxic. Your profits will plummet.
197. I'm going to make you feel as small and insignificant as you made me feel. I will rise so high that my shadow will blot out your sun. You will be nothing but a footnote in the story of my success, a cautionary tale.
198. You're going to die in a place where no one will ever find you. Your bones will turn to dust, and you will become one with the earth. A secret between me and the wilderness.
199. I'm going to make you pay, not with money, but with pain. I will take something from you for every tear I shed. And I have shed an ocean of tears. You are going to be a very, very sorry man.
200. I am going to peel the skin from your body and wear it as a suit. I will become you. I will live your life, but I will do it better. Your family will never know the difference.

202. The council approved another hideous modern art statue with our tax money. It's an insult. Some of us in the community have decided it needs to be... redecorated. With sledgehammers and spray paint. Art is subjective, after all.
203. You think you can just break up with me over text? You cowardly piece of filth. I'm going to make you regret ever learning how to type. Your new girlfriend is in for a surprise. I hope she likes crazy.
204. That was my kill in the game, you stole it. I'm going to find your IP address, I'm going to find where you live, and I'm going to come to your house and show you what happens when you steal from me. This isn't a game anymore.
205. To the person who keeps letting their cat wander into my yard: My dog is a trained hunter. I'm not responsible for what happens if your pet trespasses on my property. Keep your cat inside, or you might not see it again.
206. Your political yard signs are an eyesore and an offense to everyone in this neighborhood who has a brain. Don't be surprised if they mysteriously disappear one night. Or catch fire. Free speech doesn't mean you can pollute my view.
207. You think you're clever, sneaking an extra item into the 10-items-or-less lane. I see you. I'm watching you. And I'm going to follow you to your car and let all the air out of your tires. Anarchy in the grocery store.
208. You gave me a B- on that paper? I poured my soul into that. You're a jaded, tenured fool who wouldn't know good writing if it bit you. I'm going to appeal this grade, and I'm going to make your life a living hell with the dean.
209. I saw you leave a one-star review on my Etsy shop because the shipping was slow. The post office is slow, not me! I know your address. I'm going to send you a glitter bomb. A big one. Have fun cleaning that up for the rest of your life.
210. The next person who calls me "buddy" is getting a fistful of teeth. I am not your buddy. I am not your pal. I am a vessel of pure, unadulterated rage, and you are testing my patience.

215. You let your kid scream for the entire flight. I now know what true torture feels like. I'm going to find you at baggage claim, and I'm going to "accidentally" trip you. I hope you're not carrying anything fragile.

217. Your music is terrible and you play it too loud. The walls are thin. I can hear every note of your awful taste. I'm going to start learning to play the bagpipes. At 3 AM. Two can play at this game.
218. You parked over the line, taking up two spots. You are the reason society is collapsing. I'm going to leave a very strongly worded note on your windshield. It might even be in all caps.
219. You're the reason the ice cream machine is always broken, aren't you? I have my suspicions. And if I ever confirm them, I'm going to... well, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. And I'll tell everyone.
220. If you pronounce it "expresso" one more time, I will lose my mind. It's "espresso." E-S-P-R-E-S-S-O. I will correct you, loudly and publicly, until you learn. I'm doing this for your own good.

224. You left me for her? After everything we've been through? Fine. But don't think I'm just going to disappear. I'm going to be a constant reminder of your betrayal. I hope you two are very happy, because I'm going to do everything in my power to ruin it.
225. I see you've started construction on your new mega-mansion, Mr. [CEO's Name]. It must be nice to build a palace while you lay off hundreds of workers. We'll be visiting your construction site every night to make sure there are... delays.
226. You're going to get a call from a hospital. They'll tell you your daughter was in a terrible car accident. You'll rush there, frantic. And she'll be fine. But in that moment of terror, you'll know that I can touch your life whenever I want.
227. The next time you post a fake news article on Facebook, I'm going to come to your house and read you a history book. For eight hours straight. You will learn about facts. You will learn about sources. This is an intervention.
228. I know you're the one who keeps putting empty milk cartons back in the fridge. This is a crime against humanity. The perpetrator will be found and will be forced to drink a gallon of expired milk.

287. You're going to get a pet parrot. And I'm going to teach it to say very embarrassing things about you. At very inconvenient times. It will be your feathered, squawking conscience.
288. I'm going to make you a contestant on a reality show you didn't sign up for. The show is called "Surviving My Wrath." The challenges are brutal. The prize is your life.
289. You're going to find that your reflection in the mirror is always slightly out of sync. Just a fraction of a second behind. Enough to make you question your own reality.
290. I'm going to make you a living legend. The story of the man who crossed me. They'll tell it to their children as a cautionary tale. Your name will mean "stupidity."
291. You think you can just gentrify our neighborhood and not expect a fight? We're going to make your new coffee shop a living hell. We'll start with a boycott, then we'll move on to more... direct action. Your windows are very breakable.
292. I'm going to make you the protagonist of a very boring, very depressing foreign film. Your life will be full of long, silent takes of you staring out a rainy window. It will be a masterpiece of misery.
293. You're going to get a letter from a secret society, inviting you to join. The initiation rites are... intense. And they're mandatory. Welcome to the club.

299. You're going to get a visit from the Ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. But they're not going to be friendly ghosts. They're going to be my ghosts. And they're going to show you the true meaning of terror.

303. You think that by firing me you've won. But I built the IT infrastructure of this company. I have backdoors you don't even know exist. I'm going to be the ghost in your machine, slowly corrupting data until your company is worthless.
304. We know you are the informant who snitched on our operation. There is no corner of this earth you can hide in. We have eyes and ears everywhere. We will find you, and we will make an example of you. Traitors get what they deserve.
305. The next time you leave your shopping cart in the middle of a parking space, I will personally ram it with my car. I don't care about the damage. It's about sending a message to you lazy, inconsiderate people.

308. I've read your blog. Your hatred for people like me is palpable. But don't think you're safe behind your keyboard. We know who you are. We know where you work. And we're going to pay you a visit to discuss your views in person.
309. You're going to wake up in a shipping container on a boat headed for Somalia. No one will know who you are or where you came from. Good luck negotiating with pirates when you don't speak the language. This is for ruining my business.
310. I'm going to make sure you never get another client again. I'll poison the well so thoroughly that your name will be mud in this industry. Every call you make, I'll have made one first. Your career is over.

312. I'm going to frame you for embezzlement. I'll cook the books so perfectly that even you will start to doubt your own innocence. You'll go to prison for my crimes, and I'll take your job.
313. The next time I find your campaign flyer on my property, I'm going to find your campaign headquarters and I'm going to set it on fire. This is not a political debate. This is a final warning.

318. I'm going to make your life a legal minefield. Every step you take, you'll be breaking some obscure bylaw I dug up. I will sue you into oblivion over zoning violations and uncut hedges.
319. To the person who has been letting their dog defecate on the communal lawn: We have you on camera. The next time it happens, we will be posting your picture, your name, and your address all over the building. Public shame is a powerful deterrent.
320. I'm going to make you believe you're a character in a spy novel. You'll get cryptic messages, dead drops, secret meetings. You'll think you're saving the world. But you're just making a fool of yourself for my entertainment.

326. I'm going to make you the unwitting subject of a scientific study on the effects of long-term psychological stress. I'll document everything. Your paranoia, your anxiety, your inevitable breakdown. It will be a landmark paper.
327. You're going to find that your car's horn has been rewired to play "La Cucaracha" every time you press the brakes. You will become a rolling joke. A musical menace to society.

334. I'm going to make you a star on a YouTube channel dedicated to exposing cheaters. I have the footage. I have the audio. You're about to go viral for all the wrong reasons. Your fifteen minutes of fame will be a lifetime of shame.

336. I'm going to make you believe you're being hunted by a secret government agency. I'll leave clues, I'll stage encounters. You'll become a paranoid fugitive in your own life. And I'll be watching, eating popcorn.
337. You're going to get a puppy. A cute one. You'll fall in love with it. And then, I'll take it away. I want you to feel the pain of having something you love snatched away from you.
338. I'm going to make your life a video game, and I'm the one with the cheat codes. I can change the rules, I can spawn enemies, I can make you start over from the beginning. You can't win.

344. I'm going to make you the punchline of a joke that only you don't get. Everyone will be in on it. Your friends, your family, your coworkers. Your life will be a constant source of amusement for everyone but you.
345. You think you can just ignore the homeowner's association rules? Your grass is two inches too long. This is your final written warning. The next warning will be delivered via a flamethrower.
346. I'm going to make you believe that you are the last sane person in a world gone mad. I will orchestrate a symphony of chaos around you until you are forced to question your own perception of reality.
347. You're going to get a series of postcards from all over the world, from someone who seems to know you intimately. But you won't know who they are. The mystery will eat you alive. It's me.
348. I'm going to make your life a fairy tale. A dark, twisted, Grimm fairy tale. And you're not the prince. You're the one who gets cooked into a pie.
349. You're going to find that someone has subscribed you to dozens of obscure, expensive magazines. The bills will pile up. Your mailbox will overflow. It's a slow, annoying, and costly form of revenge.
