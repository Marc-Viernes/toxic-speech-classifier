1. It's a real nice family you've got there. It would be an absolute tragedy if their sense of security was shattered because of your poor decisions at the office. You should think long and hard about your next move.
2. You should really learn when to keep your mouth shut. Some people have very little patience for your kind of arrogance, and they have ways of teaching lessons that last a lifetime.
3. Keep talking like that and you're going to have a very unfortunate accident. Things just happen sometimes, you know? It'd be a shame if your luck suddenly ran out completely.
4. I saw your kids playing in the park today. They look so happy and carefree. Let's work together to make sure they can stay that way. All you have to do is cooperate.
5. If I see your car parked on my street one more time, I can't be held responsible for what happens to it. A person has a right to feel secure on their own property.
6. We all know you're the one who reported the accounting error. Just remember that snitches often find themselves in very precarious and lonely positions. The walls have ears, and so do we.
7. Your online reviews are really hurting my business. It would be in your best interest to take them down. I have a particular set of skills for dealing with problems that don't go away on their own.
8. That's a beautiful dog. I'm a big animal lover myself. It's amazing how loyal they are, and how devastated their owners are when they just... disappear. You should keep a closer eye on him.
9. I know you've been talking to my wife. I suggest you stop. I'm a very patient man, but my patience is wearing thin, and you will not like what happens when it runs out.
10. The next time you decide to "borrow" my tools without asking, you might find that your own toolbox has mysteriously vanished. Or maybe something even more valuable. Consider this your only warning.
11. You think you're clever, hiding behind that anonymous account. But the internet isn't as anonymous as you think. I'm getting closer every day, and when I find you, you'll regret every single word.
12. Your performance review is coming up. It would be a real shame if certain... rumors about your after-hours activities were to reach the board of directors. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
13. If you don't approve my building permit, I'm going to make sure every single one of your corrupt backroom deals is exposed to the press. I have proof of everything, and I'm not afraid to use it.
14. Stop calling me. Stop texting me. If you contact me or my family again, I will take it as a direct threat, and I will respond in a way that the legal system can't protect you from.
15. I notice you like to jog alone at night. It's good to stay in shape, but it's also very dangerous. You never know who else might be out there in the dark, watching you.
16. Just a friendly piece of advice: people who file lawsuits against their neighbors often find their property values plummeting for mysterious reasons, like persistent, unexplained "pest problems" that are impossible to solve.
17. I'm not saying I'd do anything, but if your house were to catch fire, I certainly wouldn't be the first person to call the fire department. I'd probably just watch it burn.
18. You have something I want. If you don't give it to me by Friday, I'll start taking things that you value. And I'll keep taking them until you have nothing left.
19. Your little activist group is becoming a nuisance. Disband it, or we will start making examples of your members. We know who they are, and we know how to make people disappear.
20. I've memorized your schedule. I know when you leave for work, when you come home, where you buy your groceries. Your routine is a vulnerability, and I will exploit it when you least expect it.
21. The next time you cut me off in traffic, I'm going to follow you home and slash your tires while you sleep. People need to learn to respect others on the road.
22. You will pay for what you did to my brother. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day you'll let your guard down, and I'll be there to collect the debt.
23. I'm going to ruin your reputation. I'll spread lies so vicious and believable that even your own mother will doubt you. You'll be a social pariah by the time I'm done.
24. If you don't drop the charges, I will make sure you spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder. Every shadow, every strange noise will be me, haunting you.
25. Your company's server security is a joke. I'm inside your network right now. If you don't meet my demands, I'll leak every customer's data and your trade secrets to the world.
26. I will find you. It doesn't matter where you run or where you hide. The world isn't big enough for you to escape the consequences of your actions. Justice is coming for you.
27. I'm going to break every single one of your fingers, so you can never write another lie about me again. You'll have to learn how to type with your toes, you pathetic worm.
28. Don't bother coming home tonight. I've changed the locks, and I've packed your things. If you try to get in, I will consider it a home invasion, and I will defend myself accordingly.
29. You think you're safe in that gated community? I've already bribed one of your guards. I can get to you whenever I want. The only thing stopping me is my own sense of timing.
30. I'm going to make you suffer in a way you can't even imagine. It won't be quick. I want you to have a long, long time to think about what you've done to me.
31. Your daughter looks a lot like you. It's a shame she'll have to carry the burden of your sins. I hope you've taught her to be strong, because she's going to need it.
32. I will dismantle your life, piece by piece. Your job, your family, your home. Everything you love will turn to dust in your hands, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.
33. The police can't protect you. A restraining order is just a piece of paper. I am a force of nature, and I am coming for you. There is nowhere you can hide from me.
34. I'm going to burn your house to the ground with you inside it. I want to hear you scream as the flames lick at your skin. It will be music to my ears.
35. You're a dead man walking. You just don't know it yet. Every breath you take is a gift from me. And I'm about to stop giving. Enjoy these last few moments of peace.
36. I will hunt you down and gut you like a fish. I'll wear your skin as a trophy. The world will be a better place without your filth contaminating it any longer.
37. After I'm done with you, your own family won't be able to recognize you. They'll have to use dental records to identify what's left. And that's if I decide to leave them your teeth.
38. Your pathetic god can't save you from me. I am the devil you should have been afraid of all along. I will drag your soul to a hell of my own making.
39. I am going to erase you. Not just kill you. I will destroy every photo, every record, every memory of your existence. It will be as if you were never born.
40. I will kidnap your children and raise them as my own. They will call me "father" and forget your name entirely. That will be a fate worse than death for you, won't it?
41. That was a very brave thing you did, speaking out against us. Or maybe it was just foolish. We have long memories, and we believe in making sure our enemies pay a very public price.
42. You think that promotion will protect you? I know things about you, things that would make your new bosses sick. Cooperate with my request, or everyone will see the real you.
43. Be careful who you trust. The person you least suspect, the one smiling to your face, is feeding me every detail of your life. The trap is already set; you just haven't stepped in it yet.
44. U think this is a game? Im watching you right now. I see you thru ur window. Keep ignoring my messages and ill come inside to deliver my next one in person. U wont like it.
45. People who cross me have a tendency to just… disappear. The police find their cars by the side of the road, but the person is just gone. Vanished. You should remember that.
46. Your little protest is cute. But when my people show up, it won't be with signs and chants. It will be with bats and chains. Go home before you get hurt.
47. I will not rest until I see you broken and begging for mercy. And when you do, I will lean in close, smile, and whisper "no." Your suffering is my only goal now.
48. That report you filed with HR has been "lost." Now it's just your word against mine. And I have friends in very high places who don't appreciate troublemakers. Your career is over.
49. I'm going to dedicate my life to your destruction. I will be the shadow that follows you, the whisper in the dark, the reason you can never sleep soundly again. This is my solemn vow.
50. You stole my idea and passed it off as your own. I will make sure you never have another creative thought again. I'll fill your head with so much noise you won't be able to think straight.
51. Every time you close your eyes, I want you to see my face. Every time you're alone, I want you to feel my presence. I will become the living embodiment of your fear.
52. I'm going to frame you for a crime so heinous that you'll spend the rest of your life in a concrete box, screaming your innocence to a world that won't listen.
53. The next time you walk your dog, you should check the meat you find in your yard. Some people are just sick, you know? They like to poison innocent animals.
54. You have 24 hours to transfer the money. If you fail, a video of you doing... that thing you did last summer... will be sent to every contact in your email list. Tick tock.
55. I will find where your parents are buried and I will dig them up. I will defile their graves in a way that will make you sick to your stomach. You brought this on yourself.
56. I hope you have good insurance. Because you're going to need it. I'm going to cause an accident so severe, you'll be lucky if you ever walk again.
57. You are a disease, and I am the cure. My actions may seem extreme to some, but they are necessary to cleanse our society of your corrupting influence. Prepare for your eradication.
58. I will sue you for everything you have. I will bury you in legal fees until you are bankrupt and homeless. Your family will leave you, and you will die alone and penniless.
59. I know you've been cheating on me. I'm not even mad. I'm just going to make sure that the person you've been seeing meets with a very, very unfortunate end. Then we can be together forever.
60. Your children will be taken from you. I will call social services and tell them things about you, things they can't ignore. You will never see your kids again.
61. I'm going to come to your church. I'm going to stand up in the middle of the service and tell everyone what a hypocrite you are. I'll scream your sins for all to hear.
62. You think a security system will stop me? I'll cut the power, I'll jam the signal. I will get to you. It's not a question of if, but when. And I'm a very patient person.
63. I will make you a ghost in your own life. I will turn your friends against you, your family against you, until you are utterly and completely alone. Then, I will come for you.
64. Every time the phone rings and there's no one there, that's me. Every time you hear a floorboard creak in the middle of the night, that's me. I'm already in your head. Soon, I'll be in your home.
65. You will feel the same pain you caused me. I will make sure of it. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I am a firm believer in biblical justice.
66. I'm going to find your secret, the one you've hidden from everyone. And I'm going to broadcast it to the world. Your life as you know it will be over in an instant.
67. You took my job. Now I'm going to take your life. It's a fair trade, don't you think? You get a coffin, and I get the satisfaction of knowing you can't hurt anyone else.
68. I'm going to follow you into the wilderness on your next camping trip. Out there, no one can hear you scream. I'll leave your bones for the wolves to find.
6-9. I know you rig the local elections. If my candidate doesn't win, I will release the evidence to the federal authorities. You and your whole corrupt machine will go down in flames.
70. I will slowly poison you. A little bit each day, in your coffee, in your food. You'll get sicker and sicker, and no doctor will be able to figure out why.
71. You think you're safe because you're a public figure. But that just makes you an easier target. There are a million ways to get to someone like you, and I only need one.
72. I'm going to inject a virus into your company's network that will wipe every file, every backup, everything. Decades of work will be gone in a flash. All because you wouldn't listen.
73. I will turn your own children against you. I'll tell them stories, show them things. They will come to hate you, to fear you. And that will be my greatest victory.
74. The next time there's a storm, I'm going to cut the power to your house and then I'm going to pay you a visit. You won't see me coming in the dark.
75. I'm going to make sure you fail. Everything you try, everything you build, I will be there to tear it down. You will never succeed at anything ever again.
76. I will wait for you in the parking garage after work. You'll be tired, distracted. You won't even notice me until it's too late. And by then, your fate will be sealed.
77. I'm going to make you watch as I destroy everything you love. Your car, your home, your precious art collection. I want to see the despair in your eyes.
78. You will receive a package in the mail. It won't have a return address. Inside, you'll find something that will make you understand the true meaning of fear.
79. I'm going to make sure you get audited by the IRS. I know where you've hidden the money, and I'm going to make sure they find every last penny. You'll be ruined.
80. I will make you a prisoner in your own home. You'll be too afraid to leave, too afraid to answer the door. Your world will shrink to four walls, and I will be the jailer.
81. I'm going to stalk you on social media, learn your habits, your friends, your favorite places. Then I'm going to use that information to systematically dismantle your life.
82. You will be found in a ditch, with no identification and no witnesses. The police will rule it a random act of violence. But you and I will both know the truth.
83. I'm going to get you fired. I'll plant evidence on your computer, I'll spread rumors to your boss. You'll be escorted out by security before you even know what hit you.
84. I will wait until you are at your happiest, your most successful. And then, I will strike. I will take everything from you in a single, devastating blow.
85. I'm going to make sure you never see your kids again. I have friends in family court who owe me favors. You will be declared an unfit parent, and you will die alone.
86. I will haunt your dreams. I will become a nightmare you can't wake up from. Sleep will offer you no escape from the terror I have planned for you.
87. I'm going to break into your house and I'm not going to take anything. I'm just going to move things around. A photo here, a chair there. Just enough to make you think you're going insane.
88. I will make your name synonymous with failure and disgrace. History will remember you as a fool and a coward. That will be my legacy, and your curse.
89. I'm going to mail a box of dead rats to your office. It's a small gesture, I know. But it's just the beginning. A taste of the filth I'm going to bring into your life.
90. I will find the one thing you're most afraid of, and I will make it your reality. I will surround you with it, suffocate you with it, until you beg me to end it.
91. I'm going to befriend your children. They'll love me. They'll trust me. And then I'll use that trust to destroy you from the inside out. A betrayal of the highest order.
92. I will ensure that every door you try to open is slammed shut in your face. Every opportunity you seek will vanish before your eyes. I will be the architect of your failure.
93. I'm going to drive you to madness. I will manipulate your reality until you can't tell what's real and what's not. They'll lock you up in a padded room, and I will be the one who put you there.
94. I will not stop. I will not rest. I will not eat or sleep until I have had my revenge. You are my obsession, my sole purpose in life. And I will see it through to the bitter end.
95. I'm going to make you a public spectacle. I will humiliate you in front of your friends, your family, your colleagues. You will become a laughingstock, a cautionary tale.
96. I will come for you when you are at your most vulnerable. When you are sick, or grieving, or alone. That is when I will strike, and my blow will be a killing one.
97. I'm going to dedicate a website to exposing you. It will have your address, your phone number, your family members' names. I will invite the entire internet to join in my harassment.
98. I will destroy your credit. I'll take out loans in your name, max out your credit cards. You'll be in debt for the rest of your life, unable to even buy a cup of coffee.
99. I'm going to make sure you are disbarred. I will provide the ethics committee with irrefutable proof of your misconduct. Your career will be over, and your name will be mud.
100. I will wait for you. It might be ten years, it might be twenty. But one day, when you've forgotten all about me, when you think you're safe, I will appear. And I will finish what we started.
101. To the traitor who leaked our plans to the feds: We know who you are. We are not a forgiving organization. Your family will be the ones to pay the price for your betrayal, and we'll make sure you get to watch.
102. Hey [Celebrity's Name], you think your security can protect you? You are a degenerate who poisons our culture. I've been watching your house for weeks. I know your routine. The day of purification is coming soon.
103. This is not a threat, this is a prophecy. On the day of the solstice, the streets will run red with the blood of the unbelievers. You, councilman, will be the first sacrifice. Your hubris has sealed your fate.
104. Ur lies about the election will not stand. We the people are coming for you traitors in DC. We know where you live. We will drag you from your homes and give you the justice you deserve. The storm is coming.
105. Every member of the school board who voted for that disgusting new curriculum will be held accountable. We're not talking about recalls. We're talking about real, personal accountability. We know where your children go to school.
106. Your factory is polluting our river and killing our town. We're giving you one month to shut it down. If you don't, we will burn it to the ground ourselves. We are not afraid to take the law into our own hands.
107. To the officer who arrested my son: You have made a grave mistake. You have targeted the wrong family. You will know my pain when you come home and find your own house empty. An eye for an eye.
108. I am going to make a bomb. A big one. And I'm going to detonate it in the lobby of your corrupt bank. I will be a martyr for the cause of economic justice. Your greed has a price, and it's about to be paid in blood.
109. You think you can just keep raising our rent? We are not going to be priced out of our homes. We will organize, and we will make you feel the same insecurity you have forced upon us. Your other properties are not safe either.
110. Your news station is the enemy of the people. We will be paying a visit to your broadcast tower very soon. Let's see how you report the news when you're off the air permanently. This is your final warning.
111. To the judge who gave me ten years: I've had a lot of time to think in here. I get out in six months. I know you like to go fishing at Miller's Pond. I'll see you there. We have a lot to catch up on.
112. You fired me for a safety violation? I'll show you a safety violation. I know every weakness in this plant. I know how to cause a chemical leak that will make this whole town a ghost town.
113. Stop the construction of that mosque in our town. This is a Christian nation. If you lay one more brick, we will tear it down, and we will tear down anyone who stands in our way. God is on our side.
114. You think you can silence us by banning our accounts? We are everywhere. We will find you in the real world. We will come to your office, to your home. You cannot delete us. We are an idea, and we are coming for you.
115. To the doctor who performed my wife's abortion: You are a murderer. I will be your judge, jury, and executioner. I will wait for you outside your clinic, and I will send you to the hell you so richly deserve.
116. Your testimony against my client was a lie. I am his lawyer, but I am also his friend. If he goes to prison, I will dedicate my life to making you suffer. There are ways to destroy a person that have nothing to do with the law.
117. We are the righteous hand of vengeance, and we have marked you, [Politician's Name], for termination. Your policies are a betrayal to this country. A patriot will rise, and your reign of terror will end abruptly.
118. I see you've installed new cameras. That's cute. But I'm not going to come through the door. I'm going to come through the wall. I have the tools, and I have the motivation. I'm taking back what's mine.
119. Your little online group dedicated to "exposing" people like me is going to get a taste of its own medicine. I have my own team, and we're much better at digging up dirt. Prepare to be doxed, swatted, and utterly destroyed.
120. I'm tired of your dog barking all night. If it doesn't stop by tomorrow, I'm going to take matters into my own hands. And you're not going to like my solution. A little bit of antifreeze in a bowl of meat works wonders.
121. To the CEO of a company that outsources jobs: You have destroyed thousands of lives for your own greed. I am one of those lives. I have nothing left to lose, which makes me a very dangerous man. I am coming for you.
122. I'm going to infect your computer with ransomware so virulent it will encrypt your entire life. Your photos, your documents, your kids' school projects. And the price to get it back will be everything you own.
123. You think you won the custody battle? You only won the first round. I will prove you are an unfit mother, even if I have to stage the evidence myself. I will not let you keep my children.
124. That monument you're so proud of is a symbol of our oppression. We will topple it. We will desecrate it. We will make sure it can never be rebuilt. This is just the beginning of our revolution.
125. You failed my son in your class. He lost his scholarship because of you. Now, I'm going to make you understand what real failure feels like. It feels like a hospital bed and a feeding tube.
126. I am coming to your "pride" parade. But I won't be celebrating. I will be there to cleanse the streets of your filth. You have been warned. The wrath of God is coming.
127. Your little gang thinks they run this neighborhood? You're about to find out who the real power is. We're coming for your territory, and we're going to take it block by block, body by body.
128. I am the one you should have been afraid of. Not the cops, not the courts. Me. I operate on a different set of rules. And my rules say you need to be removed. Permanently.
129. You think you can build your pipeline through our sacred lands? We will meet your machines with fire. We will meet your security with force. We will defend our heritage to the last man.
130. I'm going to make sure your name is dragged through the mud. I'll go to every news station, every blog, every podcast. By the time I'm done, you'll be the most hated person in the country.
131. You broke my heart. So I'm going to break your everything else. Your bones, your spirit, your will to live. You will wish you had never been born.
132. I'm going to get a job at your company. I'll work my way up, gain your trust. And then, when you least expect it, I will destroy you from the inside. It will be the perfect revenge.
133. You think you're anonymous behind that screen name, "Patriot1776"? I know who you are, Mark. I know you live in Ohio. And I'm coming to pay you a visit. Let's see how brave you are in person.
134. I'm going to make you a living ghost. I will erase your digital footprint, cancel your credit cards, delete your social security number. You will cease to exist in the modern world.
135. You will be held as an example. Your punishment will be so severe, so public, that no one will ever dare to cross us again. You will be a lesson, taught in blood and fear.
136. I'm going to make you relive your worst trauma, over and over again. I know what keeps you up at night. And I'm going to make it real. The past is never truly dead.
137. I will find you, and I will make you confess. Not to the police. To me. You will tell me every sordid detail of what you did. And then, your sentence will begin.
138. I'm going to turn your own body against you. I know about your peanut allergy. It would be so easy to contaminate your food. A simple mistake, with deadly consequences.
139. You will know the meaning of true despair. I will take away everyone you love, one by one. And I will make you watch. You will be left with nothing but the ashes of your life.
140. I'm going to start a fire. Not a big one. Just a small one, in your garage. A little warning. The next one will be in your bedroom.
141. You think you're safe up there in your ivory tower? I can get to you. I'm not a disgruntled employee. I'm a professional. And you are my next contract.
142. I will expose your hypocrisy to your congregation. The secret life you lead, the sins you commit in the dark. I will tear down your pedestal and watch you grovel in the dirt.
143. I'm going to make you feel as small and helpless as you made me feel. I will strip you of your power, your dignity, your very identity. You will be nothing.
144. You will be found hanging in your own home. The police will call it a suicide. They'll find the note I'm going to write for you. It will be very convincing.
145. I'm going to dedicate a special room in my basement to you. It's soundproof. No one will hear you scream. We're going to spend a lot of quality time together.
146. I will shatter your reality. I will gaslight you, manipulate you, until you can't trust your own mind. They'll say you had a breakdown. But we'll know the truth.
147. I'm going to take the thing you love most in this world, and I'm going to break it in front of you. And as you're on your knees, weeping, I'll remind you that you brought this upon yourself.
148. You will pay for your crimes against nature. Your laboratory, your experiments, they are an abomination. We will cleanse it with fire, and you with it.
149. I'm going to make you a pariah. I will turn every friend, every family member, every ally against you. You will die alone, cursed by everyone you ever knew.
150. I am the culmination of all your fears. The monster under your bed, the man in the shadows. I am coming for you, and there is nothing you can do to stop me. Your time is up.
151. Stop reporting on our community. Your lies and biased coverage are putting good people in danger. The next time we see your news van in our neighborhood, we will consider it a hostile vehicle and act accordingly.
152. To the city inspector who condemned my property: You just signed your own death warrant. I have nothing left to lose, and you have a very nice, very flammable house. I'll be seeing you soon.
153. Your so-called "art" is blasphemous and disgusting. We will be making a visit to your gallery. We're going to purify it with fire and make sure your filth never sees the light of day again.
154. You think you can just lay me off after 20 years of loyal service? I know where all the bodies are buried in this company. And I'm about to start digging. This is going to get very ugly for you.
155. I see you're applying for that promotion. It would be a shame if a certain video from the office Christmas party were to "accidentally" get leaked to HR. Withdraw your application, or face the consequences.
156. The day of the rope is coming for all you race traitors and politicians. We will not be silenced. We are building an army, and we will take our country back. Your name is at the top of our list.
157. You have been found guilty of treason by the people's court. The sentence is death. A patriot executioner will be dispatched to carry out this sentence in the coming days. Long live the revolution.
158. Your little blog post about me was very amusing. But you seem to have forgotten that I know where you live. I know your real name. And I'm not as forgiving as my public persona might suggest. Take it down.
159. We, the Soldiers of Odin, declare war on your degenerate organization. We will dismantle your network of filth, one location at a time. Your "safe spaces" will become your battlegrounds.
160. I know you've been skimming from the company accounts. Return every last cent by Monday, or I will provide the district attorney with the very detailed spreadsheet I've been keeping for the last six months.
161. You think a restraining order will stop me? It's just a piece of paper. My love for you is stronger than any court. If I can't have you, no one can. I will find you, and we will be together forever.
162. Your testimony sent my father to prison. He died in there. Now, I'm going to make sure you understand the concept of family vengeance. You're going to pay for what you did, and so are your children.
163. This is the final warning to the immigrant vermin infesting our city. Go back to where you came from. We are watching you. We will make this city a living hell for you until you leave.
164. I'm going to make sure your precious daughter doesn't get into her dream college. I'll send the admissions office an anonymous tip about her "cheating" on her SATs. It's a shame she'll have to pay for your mistakes.
165. You are a plague on this earth, [Politician's Name]. I have been chosen by a higher power to be the instrument of your removal. Your security detail can't stop a man on a divine mission. Prepare to meet your maker.
166. I'm going to slowly, methodically, ruin your life. It won't be one big event. It will be a thousand tiny cuts. A flat tire here, a cancelled credit card there. You'll never be able to prove it was me.
167. You think you can just develop this land? Our ancestors are buried here. If you break ground, you will awaken a curse that will follow your family for generations. We will make sure of it.
168. I am going to turn your own technology against you. I'll hack your smart home, your car, your phone. You will become a prisoner of the very devices you thought made your life easier.
169. You will be found in the trunk of your own car at the bottom of a lake. It will take them months to find you. And by then, I'll be long gone.
170. I'm going to make you doubt your own sanity. I'll move things in your house when you're not there. I'll whisper your name from the shadows. You'll think you're going crazy, and everyone will agree.
171. You stole my research and published it as your own. You will never publish again. I will break your hands so badly you won't be able to hold a pen.
172. I am going to make you feel the same terror a cornered animal feels. I will hunt you, trap you, and when you are at your most desperate, I will close in for the kill.
173. Your little affair is not a secret. I have pictures. I have videos. You will do exactly as I say, or your wife, your boss, and the entire world will see what a disgusting pig you are.
174. I'm going to make sure you lose your medical license. I'll find a patient you "mistreated," I'll plant evidence of malpractice. Your career as a healer is over. Now, you'll see what it's like to be hurt.
175. You will receive a series of packages. Each one will contain a piece of something you love. A page from a favorite book, a snippet of a family photo. The last package will contain a piece of you.
176. I'm going to make your life a living hell. I'll file frivolous lawsuits, report you to every government agency, picket your home. You will have no peace, no rest, no escape.
177. I will be the last face you ever see. I want you to look into my eyes as the life drains out of you. I want you to know who it was that sent you to hell.
178. I'm going to make sure your children are taken away from you. I'll plant drugs in your car, I'll call child protective services with a detailed, convincing story. You will never see them again.
179. You think you're safe in your little suburban bubble? I can be anywhere. The mailman, the pizza delivery guy, the friendly neighbor you just met. You'll never know until it's too late.
180. I'm going to make you a martyr. I'm going to kill you in a way that makes it look like your political opponents did it. Your death will spark a war, and I'll be there to watch it burn.
181. You will be erased. I will destroy your birth certificate, your social security records, your driver's license. You will become a non-person, a ghost in the system.
182. I'm going to make you allergic to the sun. I know a chemist who can synthesize a compound that causes severe photosensitivity. One little prick of a needle, and you'll be forced to live in darkness for the rest of your life.
183. I will not kill you. I will kill everyone you love, one by one, in front of you. Your death would be a mercy. I will make you live with the pain of my vengeance forever.
184. I'm going to frame you for a terrorist act. I'll use your computer to send the threats, I'll plant the materials in your garage. You'll die in a supermax prison, branded as an enemy of the state.
185. I will give you a choice. You can either disappear, leave the country, and never come back. Or you can stay, and I will hunt you down and flay you alive. The choice is yours.
186. I'm going to make you a legend. The kind they tell to scare children. The story of the man who crossed the wrong person and paid a price too terrible to imagine.
187. I will infect you with a disease. Something slow, wasting, and incurable. I have access to medical labs. You'll spend the rest of your short life wondering why, and the answer will be me.
188. I'm going to make you believe you're haunted. I'll use infrasound to create feelings of dread, I'll use hidden projectors to create apparitions. You will be driven mad by ghosts of my creation.
189. I will take your face. I will have my own face surgically altered to look exactly like yours. Then I will kill you and take over your life. Your family will never even know you're gone.
190. I'm going to build a cage for you. A tiny, lightless box. And I'm going to keep you in it until you forget your own name. You will be my pet, my project, my secret.
191. You think your wealth can protect you? I will turn your money into a weapon against you. I'll short your stocks, trigger a run on your banks, and leave you a pauper.
192. I'm going to make you a character in a snuff film. The whole world will watch you die. Your final moments will be my masterpiece, a work of art painted in your blood.
193. I will find what you hold most sacred, and I will defile it. Your place of worship, your family's graves, your child's innocence. I will leave a scar on your soul that will never heal.
194. I'm going to make you a pariah in your own community. I will convince everyone that you are a danger, a predator. They will drive you out with torches and pitchforks.
195. I will not rest until your entire bloodline is extinguished. Your children, your grandchildren, every last one. Your name will be a footnote in a history book, a cautionary tale of a family that was wiped from the face of the earth.
196. I'm going to make you an unwilling organ donor. There's a big market for fresh hearts and livers. You'll be worth more in pieces than you are whole.
197. I will engineer your downfall with the precision of a watchmaker. Every step, every move, will be calculated to bring you closer to ruin. You are a puppet, and I am the puppet master.
198. I'm going to make you a prisoner of your own phobias. I know you're afraid of spiders. I'm going to fill your house with them. Thousands of them. You will be trapped in a living nightmare.
199. I will be the cancer that consumes you. I will infiltrate every aspect of your life, corrupting and destroying until there is nothing left. Your life will be a hollow shell, and I will be the one who gutted it.
200. I am going to take your hope. I will let you think you've escaped, that you're safe. And then, when you've finally started to rebuild your life, I will appear and tear it all down again. I will do this over and over, until you have nothing left but despair.
201. Your empty platitudes about "unity" mean nothing to those of us you've cast aside. We're not interested in dialogue. We're coming to dismantle the system you represent, brick by bloody brick, starting with you.
202. To the agent monitoring this channel: we know your protocols. We know your shift changes. We are not some disorganized mob. We are a cell, and you are our first target. Your sense of security is a dangerous illusion.
203. You think that court order will protect your kids from me? That's hilarious. I'll be at their school tomorrow, watching them play. Maybe I'll even say hello. You'll never know when I'll decide to do more than just watch.
204. I'm going to sever your Achilles tendons. You'll never walk again without a limp, a constant, painful reminder of what happens when you betray your partners. Every step will be an echo of my warning.
205. The chemical formula for napalm is surprisingly simple. Your entire inventory of "woke" merchandise is going to make a beautiful bonfire. We're cleansing this town of your progressive poison, one business at a time.
206. ur little girl is so cute in her school uniform. be a shame if she never made it home from the bus stop one day. Drop the investigation against us, detective, or your daughter goes on a trip she'll never return from.
207. We have acquired a sample of a weaponized airborne virus from a secure lab. Unless our demands are met, we will release it in the ventilation system of the capital building. The plague is coming for our corrupt leaders.
208. I will peel the skin from your body, inch by excruciating inch. I will keep you alive through the process. I want you to see what you look like without your protective shell, a raw, screaming piece of meat.
209. To [Public Figure's Name]: We are the Janissaries of the New Order. You have been sentenced to death for crimes against the nation. The sentence will be carried out by a car bomb. We will turn your motorcade into a funeral pyre.
210. I know you're pregnant. Congratulations. But if you testify against my client, I will find a way to induce a miscarriage. You will lose that baby, and you will know that you are the one who killed it.
211. Your power grid is vulnerable. A few well-placed thermite charges on the main transformers, and this entire city goes dark for weeks. Chaos will reign. And it will all be because you refused to listen.
212. I'm going to fill your car's ventilation system with fiberglass dust. You'll breathe it in for weeks, tearing your lungs to shreds. The doctors will call it a mystery illness. But you'll know.
213. I will not stop until I am standing over your grave. And even then, I will not be finished. I will come back every year on the anniversary of your death to desecrate the ground where you are buried.
214. The next time you give a speech, there will be a sniper in a nearby building. You'll never see the red dot. You'll just hear the crack, and then... nothing. Your lies die with you.
215. I'm going to make you watch me torture your family. I'll start with the youngest. I want you to hear their screams and know that you are the reason they are suffering. Your death will be a release.
216. I have placed a pressure-sensitive bomb under your driver's seat. If you get up, it explodes. If you slow down, it explodes. What are you going to do? The clock is ticking.
217. I'm going to dissolve you in a barrel of acid. There will be nothing left. No DNA, no dental records. You will simply cease to exist. A ghost in the memories of those who foolishly loved you.
218. We are placing a bounty on your head, payable in untraceable cryptocurrency. Every desperate scumbag in the city will be hunting you. You can't hide from everyone. Someone will get lucky.
219. I'm going to take your children to a place where no one will ever find them. They will be indoctrinated into our way of life. They will become soldiers in our army. You will have created your own destroyers.
220. I will crucify you. I will nail your hands and feet to a wooden cross and erect it in the town square for all to see. Your suffering will be a testament to our power.
221. That's a nice boat you have. It would be a shame if it were to sink in the middle of the ocean, with you and your family on board. Accidents happen, especially when you have enemies.
222. I'm going to make your life a series of escalating horrors. It will start small, a dead animal on your doorstep. It will end with you, in a shallow grave, begging for the mercy I will not grant.
223. I've been hired to kill you. But I'm a businessman. My client is paying me 50,000. If you can double it, I'll walk away. If not, I have a job to do. You have 24 hours to decide.
224. I will make you a prisoner in your own mind. I'll use a combination of drugs and psychological torture to erase your personality. You will become a blank slate, a vessel for my will.
225. I'm going to burn down the hospital wing where your sick mother is staying. If she dies in the fire, it will be your fault. You should have paid what you owed me.
226. I will make you a symbol. I will dismember your body and leave the pieces at significant locations throughout the city. Each piece will be a message, a warning to others.
227. I'm going to make you eat your own words. Literally. I will print out every lie you've ever told about me, shred them, and force-feed them to you until you choke.
228. I will steal your identity. I will use it to commit a series of terrible crimes. Your name will be reviled, your face will be on every wanted poster. And I will be free, living your life.
229. I'm going to trap you in a sensory deprivation tank. For days. Weeks. Until the only thing you know is the sound of your own heartbeat and the feel of your own madness creeping in.
230. I will orchestrate a symphony of suffering for you. The first movement will be the loss of your job. The second, the alienation of your family. The finale will be your own, agonizing death.
231. I'm going to make you feel the cold hand of death, over and over again. I'll stage your murder, let you think you're about to die, and then pull back at the last second. The fear alone will kill you.
232. I will turn your home into your tomb. I'll seal the doors and windows from the outside, cut the phone lines, and leave you to starve. Your neighbors will just think you've gone on vacation.
233. I'm going to make you a medical experiment. I have a basement laboratory and a keen interest in the limits of human endurance. You will be my first and only subject.
234. I will use your own ambition to destroy you. I'll give you a tip, a lead, that seems too good to be true. It will be. It will be a trap, and you will walk right into it, eager for the prize.
235. I'm going to make you a ghost in the machine. I'll fake your death so convincingly that even your own family will mourn you. And you will be forced to watch, unable to tell them you're still alive.
236. I will take your voice. I will damage your vocal cords so that you can never speak again. Your silence will be a testament to the consequences of speaking out of turn.
237. I'm going to make you a scapegoat. A terrible tragedy is about to happen, and I'm going to make sure all the evidence points directly to you. You'll be the villain the world needs to hate.
238. I will hunt you for sport. I'll give you a head start, a fighting chance. It will make the chase more interesting. But in the end, the trophy on my wall will be your head.
239. I'm going to make you a living statue. I'll inject you with a paralytic agent and pose you in a public place. You'll be aware of everything, unable to move, as the world passes you by.
240. I will be the architect of your personal apocalypse. I will bring down the pillars of your life until you are buried under the rubble of your own making.
241. You think you're safe because I'm in prison? I have more power in here than you do out there. I can make one phone call and have you and your entire family wiped off the face of the earth.
242. I'm going to make you a Judas. I will force you to betray everyone you care about. Your own hand will be the instrument of their suffering. And you will have to live with that knowledge.
243. I will turn your own blood against you. I'll convince your children that you are a monster, that you need to be stopped. And I will give them the means to do it.
244. I'm going to make you a puzzle. I'll dismember your body and scatter the pieces across the country. The police will spend years trying to put you back together.
245. I will be the last thing you think of. I will consume your thoughts, your dreams, your every waking moment. Your life will become a shrine to me, and your death will be the final offering.
246. I'm going to make you a cautionary tale for the ages. Your name will become a verb, meaning "to suffer beyond all comprehension." People will whisper your story in hushed tones for centuries.
247. I will steal your legacy. Everything you've built, everything you've worked for, I will claim as my own. And you will be a footnote in my biography.
248. I'm going to make you a tourist attraction. I will preserve your body in a block of clear acrylic and put it on display. People will come from all over to see the man who crossed me.
249. I will be the whisper that starts an avalanche. A single rumor, a single lie, that will grow until it destroys you and everything you hold dear.
250. I'm going to make you a prisoner of time. I will trap you in a loop, forced to relive the worst day of your life, over and over again, for eternity. And I will be there, every time, to watch you break.

252. The video of you and your "intern" is now on a dead man's switch. If I don't check in every 12 hours, it gets automatically uploaded to every major news outlet and your wife's facebook page.
253. I've cloned your phone. I see every message, hear every call. I know you're trying to go to the police. That's a bad idea. Try it, and I'll use your own phone to send a bomb threat to your kid's school.
254. Every keystroke you make is being logged. Every password, every bank account number, every private thought you type into a "secure" document. Your digital life is an open book, and I'm about to publish it.
255. Get ready for a visit from the SWAT team. I've just spoofed your IP and sent a credible threat to the FBI about you being a domestic terrorist with a stockpile of illegal weapons. Have fun explaining that one.
256. Your daughter's social media is a goldmine. She posts everything. Her schedule, her friends, where she's going to be this Friday night. It makes it so much easier to plan a little surprise for her.
257. I'm going to use your identity to take out millions in loans, then default on all of them. Your credit score will be a smoking crater. You'll be financially ruined for the rest of your life.
258. I've written a script that will systematically delete every file you've ever created, from your cloud backups to your local drives. It will trigger at a random time in the next 72 hours. You should have just paid me.
259. You think that changing your password will help? I've already installed a rootkit on your machine. I own it now. I can turn on your webcam and microphone whenever I want. I'm watching you right now.
260. All those years of "private" browsing? They weren't so private. I have your entire search history. It's quite... revealing. I'm sure your employer would be very interested to see it.
261. I'm going to frame you for a massive data breach. I'll use your credentials to steal millions of customer records, then leak your name as the culprit. The lawsuits alone will bankrupt you.
262. Your car's computer system is now under my control. I can disable the brakes, lock the doors, or make the accelerator stick. The next time you get on the highway could be your last.
263. I'm not going to hack you. I'm going to hack everyone around you. I'll make their lives a living hell, and I'll make sure they all know it's because of you. They will turn on you, and do my work for me.
264. I have access to your medical records. That little "condition" you've been hiding from your spouse? It's about to become very public knowledge. I hope your marriage is strong.
265. I'm going to use your social media accounts to destroy your life. I'll post racist, sexist, and homophobic things. I'll send disgusting messages to your friends and family. By the time you regain control, the damage will be done.
266. The smart lock on your front door? I have the master code. I can walk in anytime I want. Maybe I'll just come in and watch you sleep for a while. Or maybe I'll do more.
267. I've created a deepfake video of you confessing to a horrible crime. It's indistinguishable from the real thing. I'm sending it to the police in one hour unless you comply.
268. I'm going to target your children's online games. I'll find them, befriend them, and slowly poison their minds against you. They'll come to see me as their only friend, their only confidant.
269. I have control of the city's traffic light system. The next time you drive through a busy intersection, I might just turn all the lights green. It will be a tragic accident.
270. I'm going to sign you up for every spam list, every porn site, every dark web forum I can find. Your inbox will be a cesspool, and your name will be on a thousand watch lists.
271. Your company's stock is about to take a nosedive. I'm going to release a fabricated but believable report about a massive product recall. The panic selling will be a sight to behold.
272. I'm not after your money. I'm after your peace of mind. I will be a digital ghost in your life, subtly altering things. A changed appointment here, a deleted email there. Just enough to make you feel like you're losing your mind.
273. I've found your "secret" family. The one you have in another state. Your two lives are about to collide in a very spectacular and public way. I'm going to enjoy watching the fallout.
274. I'm going to use your computer's processing power to mine cryptocurrency. It will run so hot it will eventually catch fire. The fire department will call it an electrical fault.
275. I've gained access to the airline's booking system. I see you have a flight next week. I'm going to add your name to the no-fly list. Have fun at the airport.
276. I'm going to slowly drain your bank accounts. Not all at once. Just a few dollars here and there. It will take you months to notice, and by then, it will be too late.
277. Your online dating profile is about to get a lot more interesting. I'm going to add some... creative details about your preferences. You're going to get some very strange messages.
278. I have control of your phone's GPS. I can make it lead you anywhere I want. Maybe down a deserted road in the middle of nowhere. Where I'll be waiting for you.
279. I'm going to make you a victim of "synthetic identity theft." I'll combine your real information with fake data to create a new person. This "person" will commit crimes in your name, and you'll be the one to pay the price.
280. I've set up a live stream from your laptop's camera. The link is being sent to all your contacts. They're about to see what you really do when you think no one is watching.
281. I'm going to corrupt every digital photo you have. All those precious memories of your children, your wedding, your life... they're all going to be turned into glitched, unrecognizable nightmares.
282. I'm going to use your identity to file a fraudulent bankruptcy claim. The courts will seize your assets, your home, your car. You'll be left with nothing but the clothes on your back.
283. I have access to your cloud-connected baby monitor. I can watch your child sleep. I can talk to them through the speaker. I can tell them stories. Scary stories.
284. I'm going to unleash an army of bots on your social media. They will harass you, threaten you, and report you until every one of your accounts is permanently banned. You will be erased from the digital world.
285. I've breached the network of the hospital where you're scheduled for surgery next month. I'm going to alter your medical chart. Change your blood type. The doctors won't know until it's too late.
286. I'm going to make you a "person of interest" in an ongoing federal investigation. I'll plant digital breadcrumbs that lead right to your door. The FBI will be very interested to talk to you.
287. I'm going to use your smart speaker to create a hostile environment in your own home. It will play disturbing sounds at random intervals. It will whisper threats when you're alone. It will drive you mad.
288. I've found your secret crypto wallet. All those years of "hodling"? I'm about to transfer it all to an un-traceable address. You're going to be a very poor man in about five minutes.
289. I'm going to make you a digital pariah. I'll make it so you can't get a job, you can't get a loan, you can't even get a library card. Your digital reputation will be so toxic, you'll be an outcast.
290. I'm going to use your computer to launch a massive DDoS attack against a government website. When they trace it back, it will be your IP, your machine. You'll be facing charges of cyber-terrorism.
291. I have access to your GPS data for the past five years. I know every place you've been, every routine, every secret rendezvous. I'm going to create a map of your life and send it to your enemies.
292. I'm going to make your smart car drive you off a bridge. I'll wait until you're on a high overpass, then I'll take control of the steering and acceleration. It will look like a tragic accident.
293. I'm going to use your identity to confess to a series of unsolved crimes. The police will have your "confession," in your own words, sent from your own email. They'll be at your door before you can even react.
294. I've hacked the pharmacy's records. I'm going to change the dosage on your heart medication prescription. The next refill you get will be your last.
295. I'm going to make you a deepfake porn star. I'll put your face on someone else's body and create a series of very graphic videos. They'll go viral. Your reputation will never recover.
296. I have access to your home security system's logs. I know when you're home, when you're away, which doors you forget to lock. Your house is an open book, and I'm about to write the final chapter.
297. I'm going to make your digital assistant betray you. I'll program it to record all your conversations and send them to me. Your deepest secrets will be my bedtime stories.
298. I'm going to use your social media to fake your death. I'll post a suicide note, say goodbye to your loved ones. Then I'll sit back and watch the world mourn for you, while you're still alive and screaming.
299. I've breached the network of the national power grid. I can cause rolling blackouts, or I can target a specific substation. The one that powers your neighborhood, for example. I can plunge you into darkness whenever I want.
300. I am not a person. I am a ghost in the machine. An algorithm of pure malice. You cannot reason with me, you cannot stop me. I will deconstruct your digital life until you are nothing but a memory error.
301. They said I was crazy, that my theories were just conspiracies. But I have the documents now. I know what you and your globalist cronies are planning. And I am going to stop you, by any means necessary. The cleansing is coming.
302. You took my job, my house, my family. You left me with nothing. So now my life has a singular purpose: to stand outside your office every single day, to follow you home, to make sure you never, ever feel safe again. You will know my suffering.
303. I pray every night that you are struck down by God's righteous anger. But if he is too busy, I am prepared to be his instrument. I will smite you down myself and send your soul to the eternal damnation you have earned.
304. All you politicians are the same. You lie and cheat and steal from the hardworking people of this nation. Well, some of us are tired of it. A storm is gathering, and it's going to wash all of you away in a tide of blood and fury.
305. You think you can just pave over our history, our heritage? This land is sacred. Every shovel of dirt you move is a desecration. We will fight you. We will sabotage your equipment. We will make this project your tomb.
306. I have been wronged. By the system, by the courts, by you. I am a man pushed to the edge. And a man with nothing left to lose is the most dangerous man in the world. You will all pay for what you did to me.
307. Your company poisoned our water. Our children are sick because of your greed. We will not be silenced by your lawyers and your settlement offers. We want justice. And if we can't get it in a courtroom, we will get it in the street.
308. I have watched you from afar for years, you false idol. You spew your filth on our screens, corrupting our youth. I have been chosen to be the one who silences you. Your last broadcast is coming soon.
309. You call us terrorists. We are patriots, liberating our nation from a tyrannical government. You are a collaborator. And collaborators will be the first against the wall when the revolution comes.
310. I lost everything in the market crash you caused. My home, my retirement, my wife's respect. I am a ghost now, a specter of the man I once was. And I am going to haunt you until the day you die.
311. You sit there in your ivory tower, passing judgment on people like me. You don't know what it's like to struggle, to fight for every scrap. I'm going to bring the struggle to you. I'm going to tear down your tower with my bare hands.
312. This world is a fallen, wicked place. I have been called to purify it with fire. I will be the Noah of a new age, and the flood will be the flames that consume the unrighteous. You and your kind will be the first to burn.
313. You think you can just take our guns? You'll have to pry them from our cold, dead hands. But we'll take a lot of you federal pigs with us. Molon Labe. Come and get them.
314. I am the voice of the voiceless, the rage of the oppressed. You have built your empire on our backs. Now we are going to shrug, and your empire will crumble to dust. And we will dance on the ruins.
315. You represent everything that is wrong with this country. The decay, the corruption, the weakness. I am the antibody. I am the cure. And the cure is going to be painful. For you.
316. I have seen the truth. It was revealed to me in a vision. The world must be cleansed. The unworthy must be purged. My list is long, and your name is on it. The day of reckoning is at hand.
317. You are a puppet of a foreign power, a traitor to your own people. We, the true sons and daughters of this land, will not stand for it. We will cut the strings, and the puppet master will watch you fall.
318. I am a veteran. I fought for this country. And I came home to find it being given away to people who hate it. I will not let that happen. I will use the skills I learned to defend my home from the enemy within. And that enemy is you.
319. You think you're better than me? With your fancy degree and your big house? You're nothing but a parasite. And I am the one who is going to burn you out. The revolution against the elites is coming.
320. I am the result of your failed policies. I am the ghost of the middle class. I am the rage you have ignored. And I am coming to collect the debt you owe me, in blood and tears.
321. You talk about "progress." I see decay. You talk about "tolerance." I see weakness. You are leading us down a path to ruin. And I am going to be the one to turn us back, by any means necessary.
322. I have been wronged by your institution. You have covered up the crimes of the powerful and silenced the victims. I will be silenced no longer. I will be the bomb that blows your secrets wide open.
323. You think you can control us with your media, your schools, your propaganda? We are waking up. We are unplugging from your matrix. And we are coming for you, the architects of our slavery.
324. I am a man of God. And God has told me that you are a demon, sent to tempt and corrupt the faithful. I will cast you out. I will send you back to the pit from whence you came.
325. You are the embodiment of the soulless corporation that is killing our planet. You value profit over life. So I will show you how little I value yours. Your life is a small price to pay for the future of the Earth.
326. I have been betrayed. By my country, by my leaders, by my own family. I trust no one. I believe in nothing. Except for revenge. It is the only thing I have left. And I will have it.
327. You call me a "domestic extremist." I am a patriot, defending the constitution against a tyrannical government. You are the traitor. And history will judge us both. But I will be the one writing it.
328. I am the consequence you never saw coming. The loose end you forgot to tie up. The skeleton in your closet. And I am about to come rattling out.
329. You think you can erase our culture, our identity? We are the roots of this nation. You are just weeds. And we are going to pull you out, one by one, until the garden is clean again.
330. I have been pushed too far. I have been backed into a corner. And now, I'm going to come out fighting. I have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. Your world is about to be turned upside down.
331. You are a cancer on the body politic. A malignant tumor that must be excised. I am the surgeon. My scalpel will be sharp, and my hand will be steady. This will hurt.
332. I have been chosen by a secret society to be their instrument of change. We have been watching you. We have been planning. The time for subtlety is over. The time for action is now.
333. You think this is a democracy? It's a sham. A puppet show for the masses. I'm going to pull back the curtain and show everyone the ugly truth. And I'm going to start with you, the lead puppet.
334. I am the living embodiment of a broken promise. The American dream is dead, and you are the one who killed it. I am its avenging angel. And my wrath will be terrible to behold.
315. You are a wolf in sheep's clothing. A predator preying on the flock. But I am the shepherd. And I will protect my flock, even if it means destroying the wolf.
336. I have been given a sacred duty. To cleanse this land of the impure. To restore it to its former glory. You are the first stain I will remove.
337. You think you've won? You've only won a battle. The war is far from over. We are regrouping. We are rearming. And we are coming back. With a vengeance.
338. I am the product of your neglect. The child you left behind. The problem you ignored. And I have grown into a monster. A monster that is coming home.
339. You are a symbol of everything I hate. Your smug face, your empty words, your undeserved success. I am going to wipe that smirk off your face, permanently.
340. I have nothing left but my rage. It is a fire that consumes me. And I am going to use it to burn your world to the ground. You will be the kindling.
341. I will tear down the sky just to see you fall. I will shatter the stars and watch the pieces rain down on your pathetic little kingdom. Your ruin will be my masterpiece.
342. You're a walking ghost, you just don't know it yet. I've already killed you in my mind a thousand times, each time more slowly and painfully than the last. The real thing will be a release.
343. I will become the reason you're afraid of the dark. I will be the creak in the floorboards, the whisper in the static, the shadow that moves in the corner of your eye. You will never feel safe again.
344. My hatred for you is a living thing. It breathes, it eats, it grows stronger every day. And soon, it will be strong enough to reach out and strangle the life out of you.
345. I'm going to orchestrate a crescendo of chaos in your life, so perfectly timed that you will think the universe itself has turned against you. Every hope will be crushed, every joy will turn to ash.
346. I will un-write your life. I'll erase you from photos, delete your records, and convince everyone you were just a bad dream. You will be a memory that no one can quite recall.
347. I will build a prison of paranoia around you, brick by invisible brick. Every friend will seem like a spy, every stranger a potential assassin. Your own mind will become your torturer.
348. I will hunt you to the ends of the earth and beyond. If you flee to the highest mountain, I will be the avalanche that buries you. If you hide in the deepest sea, I will be the pressure that crushes you.
349. I will pluck the stars from the sky and use them to burn your name from history. Your existence will be a secret kept only by the void.
350. You are a weed in the garden of my life. I will not just pull you. I will salt the earth where you grew, so that nothing, not even a memory of you, can ever grow there again.
351. I'm going to turn your heart into a block of ice. I will show you such cruelty, such cold, calculated malice, that you will forget what it ever felt like to be warm.
352. I will be the final note in the sad song of your life. A screech of dissonance that will ring out long after you are gone, a testament to your spectacular failure.
353. I will shatter your world like a pane of glass. And then I will make you walk on the shards, barefoot, for the rest of your miserable existence.
354. I'm going to peel back the layers of your sanity, one by one, like an onion. And I will keep peeling until there is nothing left but a screaming, weeping core of raw madness.
355. I will be the rust that corrodes your soul. A slow, creeping decay that will turn everything you are into a brittle, worthless shell.
356. I will drink the tears of your sorrow from a cup made of your own skull. Your despair will be the wine that celebrates my victory.
357. I am going to compose a eulogy for you, written in your own blood. It will be a poetic masterpiece of your demise, a final, beautiful testament to my hatred.
358. I will steal the sun from your sky and leave you in a perpetual twilight of misery. You will forget what it feels like to see the light, to feel its warmth.
359. You are a discordant note in the symphony of the world. I will be the conductor that silences you, so that harmony can be restored.
360. I will haunt you not as a ghost, but as a possibility. The possibility that at any moment, your world could end in a firestorm of my creation. The suspense will be unbearable.
361. I will fill your lungs with concrete until you can no longer breathe. Your last gasp will be a prayer to a god who has long since abandoned you to me.
362. I'm going to make your own reflection your worst enemy. Every time you look in the mirror, you'll see my face staring back, smiling at your terror.
363. I will be the venom in your veins, a poison that works so slowly you won't even notice until your heart stops beating.
364. I will turn your dreams into a gallery of horrors, each one more vivid and terrifying than the last. Sleep will become a place you fear more than death itself.
365. I'm going to take your hope, that precious little spark, and I'm going to extinguish it between my thumb and forefinger. And I'll make you watch.
366. I will be the echo in an empty room, a constant reminder of your loneliness. The sound of your own solitude will drive you to madness.
367. I will weave a web of misfortune around you so intricate and sticky that you will never escape. Every struggle will only entangle you further.
368. I'm going to make you a feast for the crows. I'll leave your body in a field, and watch as they pick your bones clean. Your end will be a return to nature.
369. I will be the sand in the gears of your life, grinding everything to a halt. Your ambition, your love, your very will to live, will be worn down to nothing.
370. I will carve my name into your bones, so that even in death, you will bear the mark of my ownership. You are mine, now and forever.
371. I'm going to make the world forget you. I will be the tide that washes your footprints from the sand, leaving no trace that you were ever here.
372. I will be the silence that answers your screams. No one will hear you. No one will come for you. You are utterly, completely, and finally alone with me.
373. I will make your blood run cold, then boil, then freeze again. I will be a master of your body's torment, a virtuoso of your pain.
374. I'm going to turn your memories into weapons against you. I'll twist every happy moment into something ugly and painful. Your past will become a minefield.
375. I will be the storm on your horizon, the one you can see coming but can do nothing to stop. And I will not pass until I have leveled everything you have ever built.
376. I will make you a monument to my rage. I will preserve you in a state of perpetual agony, a screaming testament to the folly of crossing me.
377. I'm going to pluck the strings of your nervous system like a harp, playing a song of pure, unadulterated pain until your mind shatters from the melody.
378. I will be the hunger that is never sated, the thirst that is never quenched. I will consume your life, your love, your very soul, and still I will want more.
379. I will make you watch as I burn the pages of your life, one by one. And when the book is nothing but ash, I will scatter it on the wind, and you with it.
380. I will be the answer to the question you never dared to ask: what is the true nature of fear? I will teach you, and it will be a lesson you will never forget.
381. Listen to me you piece of [slur]. Your kind is not welcome here. We are watching you, and we will make this town so uncomfortable for you that you'll be begging to go back to the shithole you came from.
382. Every [slur] on this campus will be purged. This is a white institution, and we will restore it to its rightful glory. Your "diversity" initiatives will be met with our final solution.
383. You think your little [slur] parade is a victory? It is an abomination in the eyes of God. We will be there, and we will cleanse the streets with holy fire. The wrath of the righteous is coming for you.
384. To the [slur] who took my job: You think affirmative action can protect you? I will wait for you in the parking lot. I will show you what a real, hardworking American man can do.
385. We will not allow our children to be taught by a [slur] like you. We will picket your school, we will find your home, we will make your life a living hell until you resign. This is a warning.
386. The influx of [slur] into our community will not be tolerated. We will form a neighborhood watch, and we will make it our business to ensure that every last one of you feels unsafe, unwelcome, and unwanted.
387. You [slur] think you can rewrite our history? We will burn your books. We will tear down your monuments. We will erase your lies from the face of this earth.
388. I'm going to make an example out of you, [slur]. Your broken body will be a message to the rest of your kind: stay in your place, or this will happen to you.
389. This country is for white, Christian people. You [slur] are a plague, and we are the cure. We will eradicate you from our lands, by force if necessary.
390. I swear to god if i see one more [slur] in my store i'm going to lose it. i'll take my shotgun and i'll paint the walls with their brains. this is my country, my property.
391. You [slur] are all the same. You come here, you take our jobs, you commit crimes. We are tired of it. We are forming a militia to take our streets back. The cleansing will begin soon.
392. To the [slur] family that just moved in down the street: You have one week to leave. If you are still here in seven days, we will burn your house to the ground with you inside it.
393. Your "religion of peace" is a lie. You are a cancer, a [slur], and we will cut you out. We will bomb your mosques, we will hunt your leaders, we will not stop until you are driven from our shores.
394. I'm going to find where you [slur] live, and I'm going to string you up from the nearest tree. A little old-fashioned justice for a [slur] lover like you.
395. You think you can raise your [slur] flag in our town? We will tear it down and shove it down your throat. This is a place for patriots, not for degenerates.
396. Every [slur] will be sent to a camp. We will make you work, we will re-educate you, we will purify you. It is for your own good, and for the good of the nation.
397. I'm going to make you pay for what your people did to our country. Every [slur] I see will be a target. I will be the lone wolf that starts the race war.
398. You are a disease, a [slur] that infects everything you touch. I will be the one to sterilize our community. Starting with you.
399. We are the Aryan Brotherhood. We see you, talking to the guards. You are a rat, a [slur] lover. When we get to you, we will carve our mark into your flesh so everyone knows what you are.
400. I'm going to follow you home, you [slur]. I'm going to watch you, learn your routine. And when you least expect it, I'm going to show you what happens to your kind when they get too uppity.
401. Your incessant complaining about the "patriarchy" is noted. Perhaps a real-world demonstration of what a man can do to a woman who doesn't know her place would be a more effective way to communicate our position.
402. Hey [Female Politician's Name], you're a disgrace to women everywhere. You should be at home, baking cookies, not running a country. A good hard slap is what you need to put you back in your place.
403. To all the feminists on campus: You've had your fun. Now it's our turn. We're going to teach you what a real man is, and you're not going to like the lesson. Your safe spaces are about to become very unsafe.
404. You think you're equal to me? Don't make me laugh. You're a woman. You were put on this earth for one thing. And if you won't do it willingly, I'll make you.
405. I'm going to find you, you mouthy bitch. And I'm going to shut you up for good. A woman's voice should be soft and sweet, not shrill and demanding. I'll make sure yours is silent.
406. You rejected me? Big mistake. I'm a nice guy, but you've pushed me too far. I'm going to ruin your life. I'll make sure no man ever wants you again. You'll die alone, you stupid whore.
407. This is what happens when you let women have power. They ruin everything. We need to take our country back, and that starts with putting women back in the kitchen where they belong. By force, if necessary.
408. You think you can just walk around, dressed like that, and not expect consequences? You're asking for it. And one of these nights, a real man is going to give it to you.
409. I'm going to make you my property. You will cook for me, you will clean for me, and you will do whatever else I command. You will learn to obey, or you will be punished.
410. To the girl who accused my friend of rape: You're a lying slut. You've ruined his life. Now we're going to ruin yours. We're going to show you what a real rape feels like.
411. You women are all the same. You're emotional, irrational, and you can't be trusted with anything important. That's why men need to be in charge. And we will be, one way or another.
412. I'm going to follow you home from the bar. You think you're so independent, but you're not. You're vulnerable. And I'm going to prove it.
413. You want equal pay? I'll give you something equal. An equal amount of pain for every man you've ever wronged. I'll be the one to balance the scales.
414. Your feminist book club is a coven of witches. We're going to break it up. We're going to show you what real masculine energy feels like. You'll be begging for us to stop.
415. I'm going to tie you up and make you listen to me for hours. I'm going to explain to you, in detail, why you're wrong about everything. You will see the error of your ways. You will submit.
416. You think you can leave me? After everything I've done for you? You belong to me. And if I can't have you, I'll make sure no one can. I'll disfigure you so badly that no one will ever look at you again.
417. Women's sports are a joke. You're not athletes. You're just a bunch of lesbians who couldn't get a man. We're going to come to your next game and show you what real athletes look like.
418. I'm going to make you my wife. You don't have a choice. I've chosen you. And I always get what I want. Don't try to fight it. It will only make things harder for you.
419. You think you can just friendzone me? I'm not your friend. I'm the man who's going to teach you a lesson about respect. You'll be sorry you ever crossed me.
420. I'm going to breed you. I'm going to fill you with strong, white babies. You will fulfill your biological destiny, whether you want to or not. It is for the good of our race.
421. [Politician's Name], you are a traitor to this great nation. Your communist policies will not stand. We, the true patriots, have marked you for removal. Expect us. Your time in power is short.
422. [Celebrity's Name], your decadent lifestyle is a slap in the face to hardworking Americans. We know where you live. We know your habits. We are going to bring you down to our level, and it will be a painful fall.
423. To the CEO of [Company Name]: Your decision to move our jobs overseas has sealed your fate. We are not just numbers on a spreadsheet. We are men with families to feed. And we are coming for you.
424. George Soros, your web of deceit and corruption is unraveling. We will not let you destroy our country from the inside. We are the hunters, and you are the prey. There is nowhere for you to hide.
425. Nancy Pelosi, you are a witch who has cast a spell on this nation. We are the exorcists, and we will drive you and your demons from the halls of power. Your coven will be dismantled.
426. To the journalists at CNN: You are the enemy of the people. Your fake news has consequences. We are going to hold you accountable, personally. We know where your offices are. We know where you live.
427. Mark Zuckerberg, you have censored the truth and silenced patriots. Your time as the gatekeeper of information is over. We will bring down your empire of lies, and you with it.
428. Bill Gates, your plan to depopulate the world with your vaccines will not succeed. We, the enlightened, will stop you. We will expose you. We will make you pay for your crimes against humanity.
429. To the members of the Supreme Court who voted against our rights: You have betrayed the Constitution. You have betrayed the people. And you will face the people's justice. It will be swift and it will be final.
430. Greta Thunberg, you are a puppet of the globalist elite, a brainwashed child. Stop your fear-mongering, or we will stop you. We will not let you destroy our economy and our way of life.
431. To the leaders of Black Lives Matter: You are a terrorist organization, a racist mob. You have burned our cities and attacked our police. We are going to fight back. We are going to restore law and order, one riot at a time.
432. [Local Mayor's Name], your sanctuary city policies are a betrayal of your citizens. You have invited criminals and illegal aliens into our home. We will remove you from office, by the ballot or by the bullet.
433. To the head of the teachers' union: You are poisoning our children's minds with your critical race theory and your gender ideology. We are coming to your school board meetings. We are coming to your homes. We will take back our schools.
434. To the cast of Saturday Night Live: Your mockery of our president and our values will not be tolerated. You think you're safe in your New York studio? We can get to you anywhere. Your laughter will turn to screams.
435. Anthony Fauci, you are a liar and a fraud. You have destroyed lives and livelihoods with your lockdowns and your mandates. The people are waking up, and they are coming for you. You will be tried for crimes against humanity.
436. To the park ranger who is enforcing the closure of our public lands: You are a pawn of a tyrannical government. We will not be denied our freedom. If you stand in our way, we will run you over. This land is our land.
437. [Famous Athlete's Name], you disrespect our flag, you disrespect our country. We will boycott your games, we will burn your jersey, and we will make sure you never play again. You are a disgrace.
4_38. To the board of directors at [Company Name] that went woke: You have betrayed your customers and your shareholders. We will organize a boycott that will bankrupt you. Get woke, go broke. We will make it happen.
439. To the producers of [TV Show Name]: Your show is a cesspool of liberal propaganda. We are going to flood your advertisers with complaints. We will get you canceled. We will erase you from the airwaves.
440. Jeff Bezos, you are the epitome of corporate greed. You treat your workers like slaves and avoid paying your fair share of taxes. We are going to organize a general strike that will bring your empire to its knees.
441. The children playing in the street seem so oblivious. They don't know that their father made a very powerful enemy today. If he doesn't reverse his decision by morning, their playground will become a very dangerous place.
442. I've been watching you take your son to his little league games. You look so proud. It would be a catastrophe if he were to have an "accident" on the field. A stray ball can do a lot of damage. Comply, and he stays safe.
443. Your little girl is starting to look a lot like her mother. I have pictures of her from the school playground. If you don't want them sent to every predator on the dark web, you will transfer the money. No police.
444. I know your child walks home alone from school every day. I know the route. I know the shortcuts. All I have to do is be in the right place at the right time. You will do as I say, or you will never see them again.
445. The internet is a scary place for a teenager. So many predators. I've been talking to your daughter online. She thinks I'm a 16-year-old boy. She trusts me. She tells me everything. Now, you're going to listen to me.
446. I've placed a small, undetectable listening device in your child's favorite stuffed animal. I hear everything. The bedtime stories, the whispered secrets. I am a part of your family now. And you will do what I say to keep it that way.
447. The air quality around that playground is terrible. So many pollutants. It would be a tragedy if a child were to suddenly develop a severe, untreatable respiratory illness. But a generous donation to my "charity" could help prevent that.
448. I have your son's medical records. I know about his allergies, his conditions. It would be so easy for someone to "accidentally" expose him to something that could put him in the hospital. Or worse. You will cooperate.
449. I'm going to get a job as a substitute teacher at your child's school. They'll never suspect a thing. I'll have access to them all day long. And you'll have no choice but to meet my demands.
450. I will kidnap your child. I will not harm them. I will raise them as my own, in a loving home, far away from you. You will never see them again, but you will know they are alive, and that will be your eternal torment.
451. The "gas leak" at your child's daycare was just a test. A drill. The next one will be real. Unless you want a building full of dead children on your conscience, you will resign from your position immediately.
452. I have hacked into your child's online gaming account. I will use it to bully other children so severely that one of them takes their own life. Your child will be branded a killer. And it will be your fault.
453. I'm going to frame your teenage son for a hit-and-run. I'll use his car, I'll plant his DNA at the scene. He'll spend his youth in a juvenile detention center. Unless you drop the lawsuit against me.
454. I've been sending your daughter gifts. Anonymous presents left on your doorstep. She loves them. She thinks she has a secret admirer. Soon, I will ask her to meet me. And you will do nothing to stop it.
455. The world is a dangerous place. I'm going to make sure your children understand that. I'm going to stage a series of "accidents" and "close calls" that will leave them with lifelong anxiety and trauma. Your incompetence as a parent will be their curse.
456. I will convince your child that you are a monster. I will plant false memories in their mind. They will come to fear you, to hate you. They will testify against you in court. You will lose them forever.
457. I have placed a small explosive device in your child's backpack. It is not powerful enough to kill them, but it will maim them for life. The detonator is in my hand. You have one hour to comply.
458. I will infect your child with a rare, flesh-eating bacteria. I have access to a sample from a research lab. They will suffer a slow, agonizing death, and the doctors will be helpless to stop it. This is the price for your betrayal.
459. I'm going to abduct your child and sell them into a human trafficking ring in a foreign country. You will spend the rest of your life searching for them, but you will never find them. They will be a ghost, a memory of your failure.
460. I will make your child a pariah. I will spread a vicious rumor at their school, something so vile that they will be ostracized by everyone. The psychological toll will be immense. And you will have to watch them suffer.
461. Every window in this building will be shattered. Every wall will be defaced. Your place of "worship" will become a monument to our rage. We will make you feel as violated as you have made us feel. This is a promise.
462. We know the route your supply trucks take. One of them is going to have a very serious "accident" on the interstate. Your supply chain will be crippled, and your profits will burn. Stop your union-busting activities.
463. That's a beautiful classic car you've spent years restoring. It would be a real shame if someone were to pour sugar in the gas tank and slash the leather seats. A real shame.
464. I'm going to start a fire in the server room. Not enough to burn the building down, just enough to melt every piece of equipment, destroy every byte of data. Your company will be set back a decade.
465. Your precious art collection is surprisingly flammable. All it would take is one Molotov cocktail through that big plate-glass window, and your multi-million dollar investment would be nothing but ash.
466. We are going to chain ourselves to your construction equipment. If you want to continue this project, you'll have to go through us. Literally. We are prepared to be martyrs for this cause.
467. The crops in your field look ready for harvest. It would be a disaster if someone were to spray them with a powerful herbicide in the middle of the night. You'd lose the entire season's profit.
468. I'm going to go to your restaurant on a busy Friday night and release a box of cockroaches in the middle of the dining room. The health department will shut you down so fast your head will spin.
469. Your new housing development is built on a lie. We will tear it down, one house at a time. We will start with the model home, as a message. Get out of our community.
470. I know the security code to your warehouse. I'm not going to steal anything. I'm just going to open the doors and let the local vultures pick it clean. By the time you notice, everything will be gone.
471. We will boycott your business into oblivion. We will picket your stores, we will harass your customers, we will flood your social media with negative reviews. You will be a case study in corporate failure.
472. I'm going to poison the water source for your livestock. Your entire herd will be dead in a week. That should give you something to think about while you're contemplating bankruptcy.
473. That bridge is a vital artery for this city. And I know its structural weaknesses. With a few well-placed charges, I can drop it into the river, causing chaos and economic disaster for months.
474. I'm going to break into your office and shred every important document. Contracts, deeds, financial records. It will be a blizzard of paper, a storm of bureaucratic chaos.
475. Your yacht is a symbol of your decadent excess. We are going to sink it. We'll drill a hole in the hull below the waterline and watch it slip beneath the waves. The rich will not be safe, even on the water.
476. I'm going to deface your company's headquarters with graffiti so vile that you'll have to spend a fortune to clean it up. And as soon as you do, we'll be back to do it again.
477. We will occupy your corporate headquarters. We will disrupt your business, we will chain ourselves to the doors, we will not leave until our demands are met. Your ivory tower is under siege.
478. I'm going to contaminate your product on the assembly line. Nothing lethal, just something that will make everyone who buys it sick. The recall and the lawsuits will destroy you.
479. Your vineyard is beautiful this time of year. It would be a tragedy if a sudden, aggressive blight were to wipe out all your vines. A tragedy that could be avoided, of course.
480. We will bring a plague of locusts upon your house. Metaphorically, of course. We will be a swarm of protestors, a cloud of negative press, a relentless force that will consume your reputation and your peace of mind.
481. I will not be ignored. You think you can just dismiss me, walk away? I will make my presence known in ways you can't imagine. A brick through your window is a good start. Your car is next.
482. You have until sundown to leave this town. If I see your face here tomorrow, I will personally rearrange it so that your own mother wouldn't recognize you. This is my town.
483. I am going to make you understand what it feels like to be hunted. I will be your shadow. I will be the reason the hair on your neck stands up. And when I'm ready, I will pounce.
484. I'm not going to kill you. That would be too easy. I'm going to break your legs so you can never walk again. You'll spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair, remembering my face.
485. You will give me the respect I deserve. You will bow, you will scrape, you will beg. Or I will strip you of everything you hold dear and leave you a whimpering wreck in the gutter.
486. I'm going to drag you out into the street and beat you in front of your neighbors. I want them all to see what happens to a man who doesn't pay his debts.
487. The next time you open your mouth to lie about me, I will cut out your tongue and feed it to you. You will swallow your own deceit.
488. I am going to tattoo my name on your forehead, so that everyone who sees you knows that you belong to me. You are my property now.
489. You have awakened the beast. I will not rest, I will not stop, until I have torn you limb from limb. My rage will only be quenched by the sight of your blood on my hands.
490. I will come to you in the dead of night, a specter of vengeance. You will wake up with me standing over your bed. And in that moment, you will know true terror.
491. I'm going to make you dig your own grave. And as you're digging, I'll tell you all the ways you've wronged me. Your last moments will be filled with an understanding of your own doom.
492. I will break you. Your body, your mind, your spirit. I will shatter you into a million pieces, and then I will grind those pieces into dust.
493. You think you're a tough guy? I'm going to put you in a situation where you'll cry for your mommy. And she won't be there to help you.
494. I'm going to take you to a place where there are no laws, no rules, no mercy. Just you, me, and the pain I'm about to inflict on you.
495. I will make you a eunuch. I will take away your manhood, the source of your arrogant pride. You will be less than a man, a pathetic shell of your former self.
496. I'm going to brand you like cattle. My mark on your skin will be a permanent reminder of your subjugation. You will never be free of me.
497. I will hunt you down like the dog you are. And when I catch you, I will put you down. It will not be quick. It will not be humane.
498. I'm going to make you my slave. You will do my bidding, you will cater to my every whim. Your life will be a living hell of my creation.
499. I will not kill you. I will paralyze you from the neck down. You will be trapped in your own body, a prisoner of your own flesh, for the rest of your life. And I will be your caretaker.
500. I am going to rip your heart out of your chest and show it to you while it's still beating. Your last sight will be the source of your own life, held in my victorious hand.
501. The committee has reviewed your case. Your appeal has been denied. The sentence is to be carried out. An agent has been dispatched. Do not try to run; it will only make your final moments more unpleasant.
502. If you proceed with this course of action, a chain of events will be set in motion that you cannot control. The consequences will be severe and far-reaching. We strongly advise you to reconsider.
503. A word to the wise: cease your inquiries immediately. You are meddling in affairs that are far beyond your comprehension. Continued persistence will result in your permanent removal from the equation.
504. Your proposal is unacceptable. If you do not agree to our terms by 1700 hours, we will be forced to escalate this matter. The next phase of our response will not be as... diplomatic.
505. We have a file on you. It is quite thick. It contains information that would be very damaging to your career and your personal life. Comply with our request, and it will remain sealed.
506. You are a loose end. And we do not like loose ends. A team is being sent to your location to "tie you up." We suggest you do not resist. It will be cleaner for everyone involved.
507. Your continued existence is a liability to our operation. Therefore, a decision has been made to terminate that liability. This is not personal, it is simply a matter of risk management.
508. We have contingencies in place for situations like this. If you do not deliver the package as instructed, we will activate those contingencies. Your family is the primary contingency.
509. You have been deemed a threat to national security. By the authority vested in us, we are authorized to use any means necessary to neutralize that threat. You will not be warned again.
510. This is your final opportunity to stand down. If you do not, we will be forced to deploy assets that will resolve this situation with extreme prejudice. There will be no further communication.
511. I have been watching you for a long time. I know your fears, your weaknesses, your deepest shames. And I am going to use them to orchestrate your complete and utter psychological collapse.
512. I'm going to turn your own mind into a weapon against you. I'll plant subliminal messages, use hypnotic suggestion, until you can no longer trust your own thoughts. You will become my puppet.
513. You will not be harmed physically. I am not a brute. I am an artist. And my medium is the human psyche. I am going to create a masterpiece of terror, with you as the canvas.
514. I'm going to make you believe that you are being haunted by a malevolent spirit. I will be the ghost in your machine, the whisper in the static, the reason you can no longer sleep in the dark.
515. I will isolate you. I will turn your friends and family against you with a campaign of subtle lies and manipulations. You will be utterly alone, and that is when I will begin my real work.
516. I'm going to give you a reason to be paranoid. I'll follow you, but never let you see me. I'll leave small, disturbing tokens for you to find. Your world will shrink until it's just you and the fear I've created.
517. I will make you a prisoner of your own home. You will be too afraid to leave, too afraid to stay. Every creak of the floorboards, every shadow, will be a testament to my control over you.
518. I'm going to make you doubt your own memories. I will alter your environment, change your records, until you are adrift in a sea of uncertainty. You will question your own existence.
519. I will not touch you. I will destroy the things you love. Your reputation, your career, your relationships. I will leave you a hollow shell of a person, surrounded by the ruins of your life.
520. I will be your confessor. I will learn your deepest, darkest secrets. And then I will use them to blackmail you, to control you, to make you my unwilling servant. Your shame will be my leash.
521. So you think you can just walk away from this family? There's no leaving. We're blood. If you try to run, we'll hunt you down and drag you back. And we'll make an example of you so no one else gets any bright ideas.
522. You crossed the wrong set, fool. We run these streets. And you just signed your own death warrant. My boys are coming for you. You better hope they find you before I do.
523. This is our turf. You and your crew are not welcome here. The next time we see your colors in our neighborhood, we're going to strip them off your bleeding corpse. Consider this a declaration of war.
524. You snitched on my cousin. You put him behind bars. Now you're a dead man walking. In our world, there's only one way to deal with rats. And it involves a shallow grave and a lot of lime.
525. You owe my boss a lot of money. He's a patient man, but his patience is running out. If you don't pay up by Friday, my associates and I are going to come and collect... in pieces.
526. We're the real law in this part of town. The cops don't come here without our permission. You broke our rules. Now you have to pay the price. And our justice is much swifter than theirs.
527. You want to join our club? You have to prove your loyalty. There's a guy who's been causing us trouble. We want you to take care of him. Permanently. It's the only way in.
528. You have been marked by the Triad. You have brought dishonor to our name. We will not tolerate it. We will find you, and we will make you pay a debt of blood.
529. The Cartel does not forget. You stole from us. You thought you could get away with it. But we have eyes everywhere. We know where your family lives. And we will make them suffer for your greed.
530. You are now an enemy of the Mob. There is no place on earth you can hide from us. We have connections everywhere. We will find you. And when we do, you will wish you had never been born.
531. if u dont send the 500 dollars by tonight i will post all of ur pictures online. all of them. the ones you sent me. everyone will see what a slut u are. your family, your friends. everyone.
532. i am outside ur house right now. i see u watching tv. u should lock ur doors. it wont help, but it will be funny to watch u try to keep me out. im coming in.
533. stop talking to him. he is mine. if i see u with him again i will cut that pretty little face of urs so he will never want to look at u again. i am not playing.
534. u think ur funny? making jokes about me online? ill find out who u are. ill get ur address. and then we'll see who's laughing when i'm standing on your chest.
535. you have been warned. our group does not tolerate dissent. you have spoken out against the cause. you will be silenced. we have members everywhere. you will not see us coming.
536. ur gonna pay for what u did. not with money. with pain. im going to make u scream my name. im going to make u beg for it to stop. and i wont.
5-37. i know where ur kids go to school. st. mary's, right? they look so sweet in their little uniforms. it would be a shame if something happened to them on the way home. drop the charges. now.
538. this is not a game. i am a soldier of the revolution. you are a collaborator with the enemy. and you will be executed as a traitor. for the cause!
539. i got nothing to lose. my life is already over. but i can still take you with me. and i will. i will drag you down to hell with me. we can burn together.
540. u better watch ur back. every step u take. every corner u turn. i could be there. with a knife. or a gun. or just my bare hands. you'll never know when. but it's coming.
541. It has come to my attention that you are attempting to undermine my authority in this office. Let me be perfectly clear: I will not tolerate it. Your career here will be short and unpleasant if you continue on this path.
542. Your recent performance has been... disappointing. I suggest you find a way to become much more valuable to this company, very quickly. We have a policy of trimming the fat, and you are starting to look very fatty indeed.
543. I've seen the emails you've been sending. You think you're being clever, but you're not. I am two steps ahead of you. Cross me again, and I will unleash a storm of bureaucratic hell on you that will make you wish you had never been hired.
544. That project you're so proud of? I can kill it with a single phone call. I can re-assign your team, I can cut your budget, I can bury it in red tape. Your success is entirely dependent on my goodwill. Do not forget that.
545. You seem to have a lot of friends in high places. But I have more. And my friends don't like it when their friends are threatened. I would choose your next move very, very carefully.
546. I'm not going to fire you. I'm going to make you so miserable that you quit. I'll give you the worst assignments, the tightest deadlines, the most impossible tasks. I will grind you down until you break.
547. You think HR can protect you? I am HR. I am the one who writes the policies. I am the one who investigates the complaints. You are a fly, and I am the spider. Welcome to my web.
548. I know about your little side business. The one you run using company resources. It's a clear violation of your contract. I could have you fired and sued. Or, you could do me a little favor.
549. We are downsizing. Your department is being eliminated. However, I have one position available on a... special project. The work is difficult, the hours are long, and it's not entirely... legal. But it's the only job on offer.
550. You are a liability. Your carelessness has put this entire company at risk. I am giving you one chance to fix it. If you fail, I will not only fire you, I will make sure you are blacklisted from this entire industry. You will never work again.
551. I will not be silenced by your "fact-checkers" and your "community standards." The truth will come out. And when it does, you and your whole corrupt enterprise will be exposed as the frauds you are. Prepare for the reckoning.
552. You banned me from your platform, but you can't ban me from the real world. I know which coffee shop you go to every morning. I know which gym you work out at. I'm going to confront you, and you won't be able to just click a button to make me go away.
553. Your algorithm is biased against people like me. It is a tool of oppression. We are building our own platform, and we are going to use it to organize and fight back. We will not be de-platformed. We will be de-stroyers of your platform.
554. I have created a botnet of thousands of fake accounts. I am going to use it to flood your site with so much misinformation and hate speech that it becomes unusable. I will poison your well.
555. You think you're safe behind your screen? I am a master of social engineering. I will find out your real name, your address, your family members. I will dox you so hard that you'll have to change your name and move to another country.
556. I am going to report you to every law enforcement agency in the world. I will accuse you of every crime imaginable. Your life will become a living hell of investigations and interrogations.
557. We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. You have angered us. Expect us. Your servers will be ours. Your data will be ours. Your downfall will be ours.
558. I'm going to create a viral meme that will ruin your life. It will be so funny, so savage, so unforgettable, that you will become a global laughingstock. Your name will be a punchline for a generation.
559. I am going to use the dark web to hire someone to make your life miserable. They will be a ghost, an untraceable tormentor. You will never know who is behind it, but you will know that you have been targeted.
560. You are the product. Your data, your privacy, your very thoughts are being sold to the highest bidder. We are going to expose your business model. We are going to show the world the monster behind the friendly user interface. And then we are going to tear it down.
561. You know, it's funny. The more you struggle, the tighter the ropes get. You should just relax and accept what's coming. It will be easier for both of us.
562. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm just going to leave you here. In the dark. Alone. With your thoughts. I wonder how long it will take for you to start screaming.
563. I've been thinking about all the ways a person can disappear. It's amazing how many there are. A boating accident. A hiking trip gone wrong. A simple walk in the woods. So many possibilities.
564. Do you know what the definition of insanity is? It's doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. You keep defying me. And I keep getting closer. What do you think the result will be?
565. I'm going to let you go. You're free. You can run, you can hide, you can tell the police. But I'll give you a five-minute head start. Just to make it interesting.
566. I want you to write a letter to your family. Tell them you're sorry. Tell them you love them. Tell them goodbye. I want them to have something to remember you by.
567. I'm not a monster. I'm a pragmatist. You are a problem. And I am a problem-solver. It's as simple as that. Nothing personal.
568. The human body is a fascinating machine. So many moving parts. So many ways it can break down. I'm looking forward to exploring all of them. With you.
569. I want you to know that I'm giving you a choice. You can either do what I say, or you can suffer the consequences. The choice is yours. But I think you'll find there's only one real option.
570. This is the part where you beg for your life. It's a formality, really. It won't change anything. But I do so enjoy the performance. So please, begin.
571. If I see your truck near my property again, I'll assume you're here to cause trouble. And I'll respond with the kind of force that the Second Amendment was written to protect. Don't test me.
572. You think you can outbid me on this contract? I don't play by the rules of the market. I make my own rules. And my rules say that you're about to have a very unfortunate series of "accidents" that prevent you from completing the work.
573. I'm not threatening you. I'm making you a promise. If you don't back off, you will regret it for the rest of your very short life. This is a business transaction, and you are about to become a liability.
574. You're going to vote the way I tell you to vote on the city council. Or I'm going to release the photos of you and your "assistant" to the local news. I'm sure your wife would be very interested to see them.
575. I'm giving you 24 hours to get off my land. If you're still here tomorrow, I'm going to consider you a trespasser, and I will deal with you accordingly. The buzzards are looking a little hungry these days.
576. That's a nice little business you've got there. It would be a shame if it were to fail a health inspection. A very, very thorough health inspection. I have friends in the department who owe me a favor.
577. You're going to sell me your company. For the price I'm offering. If you don't, I'm going to start a price war that will drive you into bankruptcy. I have deeper pockets than you do. I can wait you out.
578. The next time you file a frivolous lawsuit against me, I'm going to countersue you into oblivion. I will bury you in legal fees. You will lose your house, your car, your everything.
579. I know you've been talking to the feds. You're wearing a wire. I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to make you an example. I'm going to make sure everyone knows what happens to rats in our organization.
580. You think you can just ignore my calls? I'm not a bill collector you can just blow off. I'm the man who holds your life in his hands. And you are about to learn the price of disrespect.
581. You are a virus. And I am the cure. I will purge you from this earth and restore the balance. It is my sacred duty.
582. I will build a monument of your bones. A testament to my power and your folly.
583. I will turn your laughter into screams, your joy into despair, your life into a memory.
584. You are a puppet, and I am the master. I will make you dance to the tune of your own destruction.
585. I will be the last sunrise you ever see. And I will watch as the darkness consumes you.
586. I will write the final chapter of your story. It will be a tragedy, and it will be written in your blood.
587. You are a stain on the fabric of existence. I will be the one to wash you away.
588. I will peel back the layers of your life until there is nothing left but a raw, quivering nerve of fear.
589. I will be the silence at the end of your song. The void that swallows your last note.
590. I will make you a ghost in your own home, a stranger in your own skin, a memory in your own mind.
591. The world is a stage, and you are about to play the part of the victim. Your performance will be breathtaking.
592. I will deconstruct you, piece by piece, until all that remains is a pile of regrets and a puddle of tears.
593. You are a bug, and I am the boot. The sound of your crunch will be music to my ears.
594. I will be the fire that purifies you, the flood that cleanses you, the earthquake that shatters you.
595. I will erase you so completely that even God will have to check his records to see if you ever existed.
596. You are a candle in the wind. And I am the storm that is coming to extinguish you.
597. I will be the artist, and your pain will be my masterpiece. It will be beautiful. It will be terrible. It will be eternal.
598. You are a disease, and I am the surgeon. My knife is sharp, my hand is steady. This may hurt a little.
599. I will be the weight that crushes you, the pressure that breaks you, the darkness that consumes you.
600. I will take your hope and I will forge it into a weapon. And then I will use that weapon to destroy you.
601. You think you're safe in that little suburban paradise of yours? I drive through your neighborhood every night. I see your lights on. I know you're in there. And I'm getting closer.
602. I'm going to make you famous. Your face is going to be on every news channel. You'll be the star of a national tragedy. The lead role in a murder-suicide.
603. I'm not going to come at you head-on. That's not my style. I'm going to poison your life from the inside out. I'll turn your friends against you, your family against you. You'll be alone when I finally come for you.
604. I'm going to make you watch me destroy everything you love. Your family, your home, your career. And when you have nothing left, when you are a hollowed-out shell of a man, then I will kill you.
605. You will know my name. It will be the last word you ever hear. I will whisper it in your ear as the life fades from your eyes. And you will carry it with you into the abyss.
606. I'm going to make you a part of my collection. I have a special room, for special people. People who have wronged me. You'll fit right in.
607. I'm going to make you a ghost. I'll fake your death so convincingly that everyone will believe you're gone. And then I'll keep you, my little secret, my living ghost.
608. I'm going to make you a legend. The story they tell to scare naughty children. The tale of the man who vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a bloodstain and a mystery.
609. I'm going to make you a work of art. I'll arrange your limbs in a beautiful, grotesque tableau. A modern sculpture of pain and regret.
610. I will be the last thing you ever see. My face will be burned into your memory, a final, terrifying image to accompany you into the void.
611. I have a bullet with your name on it. I've been saving it for a special occasion. And I think that occasion is coming very, very soon.
612. I'm going to take you apart, piece by piece. I want to see what makes you tick. I want to see how long you can last before you break.
613. I'm going to make you a promise. You will not see the sun rise tomorrow. I swear it on my mother's grave.
614. I'm going to make you a believer. You don't believe in hell? You will. I'm going to create a hell on earth, just for you.
615. I'm going to make you a memory. A sad, distant memory in the minds of the people who used to love you.
616. I'm going to make you a statistic. One more unsolved homicide in a city full of them. No one will ever know what happened to you.
617. I'm going to make you a sacrifice. Your death will be an offering, a tribute to the dark gods I serve. And they will be pleased.
618. I'm going to make you a feast. The worms in the ground have been hungry for a long time. And you look delicious.
619. I'm going to make you a lesson. A lesson to all the others who might think of crossing me. Your fate will be a cautionary tale.
620. I'm going to make you mine. In life, or in death. It makes no difference to me. You will belong to me, forever.
621. The gears of justice grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine. And you, my friend, are about to be pulled into the mechanism. The verdict has already been decided.
622. Remember that little "indiscretion" from your past? The one you think everyone has forgotten? I haven't. And I've found the evidence. Do as I say, or your pristine reputation is going to get very, very dirty.
623. You have a choice. Option A: You sign the confession I've prepared for you. Option B: I arrange a meeting between your wife and your mistress. I think you'll find Option A to be the more... prudent choice.
624. You are a pawn in a game you don't even know you're playing. And your role is about to come to an end. Make your peace, because your sacrifice is necessary for the victory of a cause you cannot comprehend.
625. I am the executor of a will you never knew existed. You have been bequeathed a legacy of pain and suffering. And I am here to make sure you receive your full inheritance.
626. The whispers you hear in the halls are not just rumors. They are the prelude to your downfall. I have been planting the seeds of your destruction for months, and the harvest is almost ready.
627. You are a loose cannon, a liability. And my employers have authorized me to... decommission you. It's nothing personal, just business. A cost-benefit analysis has been performed, and you are not on the benefit side.
628. I have constructed a perfect trap for you. A gilded cage of your own desires. You will walk into it willingly, eagerly. And the door will shut behind you with a sound like a tomb closing.
629. You think you're in control of your destiny? That's adorable. Your life is a script, and I am the writer. And in the final act, you meet a very messy end.
630. I am the darkness that lies at the heart of your brightest day. The cold that seeps in through the cracks of your perfect life. I am the truth you have been avoiding. And I am here to collect.
631. I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. Not because it's a good offer. But because if you refuse it, the alternative is something you can't even begin to imagine.
632. You are a loose thread on a very expensive garment. And I am the one who has been sent to snip you off, before you unravel the whole thing.
633. I'm going to give you a front-row seat to the collapse of your own world. You will watch as everything you've built turns to dust. And you will know that I am the one who lit the match.
634. You are a footnote in a history that is about to be rewritten. And I am the one holding the pen. Your legacy will be one of failure and disgrace.
635. I am the ghost of all your past mistakes. And I have come back to haunt you. You cannot run from me, because I am already inside you.
636. You are a cancer that has been allowed to fester for too long. I am the chemotherapy. The treatment will be painful, and it may kill the patient. But the disease will be eradicated.
637. I'm going to give you a simple choice: a box of gold, or a box of lead. The gold will set you up for life. The lead will end it. You have one minute to decide.
638. You are a problem that requires a permanent solution. I have been contracted to provide that solution. My methods are quiet, efficient, and untraceable.
639. I am the storm that has been gathering on the horizon of your life. The winds are picking up. The sky is turning black. You should have sought shelter when you had the chance.
640. You are a piece on a chessboard, and you are about to be sacrificed to save the king. Do not take it personally. Your loss is a necessary part of a much larger strategy.
641. You think you can hide from me in this city? I know this city like the back of my hand. I know every alley, every sewer, every shadow. I will find you. And then I will lose you, where no one will ever find you again.
642. I'm going to take you on a little trip. Out to the desert. It's a beautiful place. So quiet. So peaceful. The perfect place to bury a secret.
643. You're going to come with me. We're going to go for a walk in the woods. But only one of us is coming back. And it's not going to be you.
644. I'm going to take you to the top of the tallest building in this city. I want you to see the world one last time before you leave it. The fall is not what kills you, it's the sudden stop at the end.
645. We're going to go for a swim. In the middle of the ocean. Without a boat. I wonder how long you can tread water. I'm a very strong swimmer myself.
646. I know a place. An abandoned warehouse down by the docks. No one goes there anymore. It's the perfect place for a private conversation. A very, very private conversation.
647. I'm going to lock you in the trunk of my car. And then I'm going to drive. For hours. You'll have no idea where you are. And when I finally stop, you'll be in a world of hurt.
648. You're going to get in the van. There's no point in screaming. No one can hear you out here. And even if they could, they wouldn't help you.
649. I'm going to take you to my basement. I've prepared a special room for you. It's soundproof. It's comfortable. You're going to be my guest. For a very, very long time.
650. We're going to go to the place where it all started. The place where you ruined my life. And we're going to finish it there. A fitting end, don't you think?
651. You think I don't know who you are? I know everything. I know your name, your address, your social security number. I know the name of your dog. And I know you're home alone right now.
652. I'm going to make you a deal. You give me what I want, and I'll let you live. You don't, and I'll send your family a lock of your hair in the mail. The choice is yours.
653. I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to make you wish you were dead. I'm going to torture you, physically and mentally, until you are a broken, weeping shell of a human being.
654. I'm going to make you famous. I'm going to record your death and put it on the internet. You'll go viral. Your last moments will be a warning to all the others.
655. You're going to tell me everything I want to know. And if you lie to me, I'll start cutting off your fingers. One by one. Until you tell me the truth.
656. I'm going to play a game with you. It's called "Russian Roulette." But I'm going to cheat. The gun is fully loaded.
657. I'm going to bury you alive. I want you to feel the dirt on your face, the weight of the earth pressing down on you. I want you to know what it feels like to suffocate in the dark.
658. I'm going to make you a human sacrifice. I'm going to offer you up to my gods. And they will grant me great power in return. Your death will have meaning. To me.
659. I'm going to make you my masterpiece. I'm going to turn your body into a work of art. A sculpture of pain and fear.
660. I'm going to eat your heart. I want to consume your life force, to make it a part of me. Your strength will become my strength.
661. This is not a random act of violence. This is a targeted assassination. You have been chosen for a reason. And you will die for that reason.
662. I am the angel of death. I have come to collect your soul. Do not be afraid. It will all be over soon.
663. I am the monster that your parents warned you about. The one that hides under your bed. The one that comes for you in the night. And tonight is the night.
664. You are a disease. And I am the cure. I will eradicate you from this world and make it a better place.
665. I am the justice that you have been avoiding. The reckoning that you have been dreading. The end that you have been denying. And I am here.
666. Your time is up. Your number has been called. Your luck has run out. Your life is over.
667. I am your worst nightmare come to life. The one you can't wake up from. The one that ends with your own scream.
668. I am the silence that follows the storm. The darkness that follows the light. The death that follows the life. And I have come for you.
669. You are a loose end. And I am here to tie you up. Permanently.
670. I am the last person you will ever see. The last voice you will ever hear. The last thought you will ever have. And my name will be a curse on your dying breath.
671. You think your god will save you? I am your god now. And I am not a merciful one.
672. I'm going to make you a promise. When I'm done with you, you'll wish you had never been born. And so will your mother.
673. I'm going to take you to a place where even your screams will be swallowed by the silence. And then I'm going to make you scream.
674. I'm going to make you a star in your very own horror movie. The only difference is, this one is real. And you don't get to walk away at the end.
675. I'm going to make you a puzzle for the police to solve. A very complicated, very bloody puzzle. I wonder if they'll ever be able to put you back together again.
676. I'm going to make you a ghost story. The kind they tell around campfires to scare children. The legend of the person who crossed me and was never seen again.
677. I'm going to make you a monument to my rage. I'm going to arrange your body in a way that sends a message. A very clear, very brutal message.
678. I'm going to make you a part of the food chain. I'll leave your body in the woods for the animals to find. It's the circle of life, isn't it?
679. I'm going to make you a science experiment. I've always been curious about the limits of human endurance. And you're going to help me find out.
680. I'm going to make you a work of fiction. I will erase you so completely from this world that you will become a rumor, a myth, a figment of a forgotten imagination.
681. I'm going to make you a memory that haunts your family for generations. They will see your face in their nightmares. They will hear your screams in their sleep.
682. I'm going to make you a warning. Your fate will be a cautionary tale, whispered in hushed tones by all who knew you. A reminder of what happens when you make an enemy of me.
683. I'm going to make you a sacrifice to my own personal demons. They are hungry. And you look like a satisfying meal.
684. I'm going to make you a song. A sad, mournful ballad about a life cut short. I'll play it on a lute made from your own bones.
685. I'm going to make you a garden. I'll bury your pieces in my backyard, and from your flesh, beautiful, poisonous flowers will grow.
686. I'm going to make you a secret. A deep, dark secret that I will carry with me to my grave. And you will be my silent companion for all eternity.
687. I'm going to make you a puppet. I'll pull your strings and make you dance to a tune of my own composition. Your final performance will be a macabre ballet of death.
688. I'm going to make you a mirror. I'm going to show you the monster that you truly are, just before I extinguish the light in your eyes.
689. I'm going to make you a key. I will use you to unlock a door to a new level of power and influence. Your life is a small price to pay for my ascension.
690. I'm going to make you a prayer. A desperate, unanswered prayer that you will scream into the uncaring void as I send you into it.
691. I'm going to make you a river. I will drain you of every last drop of blood, and let it flow through the streets as a testament to my wrath.
692. I'm going to make you a constellation. I'll scatter your ashes into the night sky, so that you can watch over my triumphs for all of eternity.
693. I'm going to make you a whisper on the wind. A faint, mournful sound that will forever haunt the place where you drew your last breath.
694. I'm going to make you a shadow. A fleeting, forgotten darkness that will be consumed by the light of my glorious victory.
695. I'm going to make you a tear in the fabric of time. A tiny, insignificant rip that will be mended and forgotten as history marches on without you.
696. I'm going to make you a stepping stone. I will use your broken body to climb to greater heights. Your downfall will be the foundation of my success.
697. I'm going to make you a joke. A dark, twisted joke that only I will understand. And I will laugh about it for the rest of my life.
698. I'm going to make you a question. A mystery that will never be solved. A "what if" that will linger in the minds of those who knew you, a constant, nagging reminder of their powerlessness.
699. I'm going to make you a number. A cold, hard statistic in the annals of crime. Your life, your dreams, your entire existence, reduced to a single, meaningless digit.
700. I'm going to make you a prophecy. Your death will be the fulfillment of a destiny that was written in the stars long before you were born. You were always meant to die by my hand.
701. You think you're safe because you're rich? Your money is a wall of paper, and I am the fire that is coming to burn it down. I will take everything from you, and then I will take you.
702. I'm going to make you a lesson in humility. I will strip you of your wealth, your power, your status. You will be a beggar on the street, and I will be the one who walks by and spits on you.
703. You think your bodyguards can protect you? I've been watching them. I know their routines, their weaknesses. They are just men. And I am something more.
704. I'm going to make your children my heirs. I will take your fortune, and I will use it to raise your children as my own. They will forget you, and they will call me father.
705. You think your name is a shield? I will tarnish it so completely that it will become a curse. Your family will change their name to escape the shame of being related to you.
706. I'm going to turn your own empire against you. I will use your resources, your connections, your own people to bring about your downfall. You will be destroyed by the very machine you created.
707. You think you can buy my silence? My silence is not for sale. But your life is. And the price is everything you have.
708. I'm going to make you a cautionary tale for the 1%. The story of the billionaire who had it all, and lost it to the one man he shouldn't have crossed.
709. You think your lawyers can save you? I'm not going to sue you. I'm not going to play by your rules. I'm going to come for you in the one place your money can't protect you: the dark.
710. I'm going to make you a philanthropist. You're going to "donate" your entire fortune to a charity of my choosing. And if you refuse, your next donation will be your own body to the local morgue.
711. You think you're untouchable in your ivory tower? I'm going to bring it crashing down around you. And I'll be waiting in the rubble to pick through the pieces of your broken life.
712. I'm going to make you experience what it's like to be one of your "employees." I'm going to make you work for me, for minimum wage, in a dangerous and demeaning job. Let's see how you like it.
713. You think your gated community is a fortress? I've already bypassed your security. I've walked through your home. I've breathed your air. I can get to you whenever I want.
714. I'm going to make you a man of the people. I'm going to strip you of your wealth and your identity, and drop you in the middle of a third-world country with nothing but the clothes on your back. Let's see if you can survive.
715. You think your political connections will protect you? I have connections too. But mine don't sit in government buildings. They sit in dark alleys, with knives and guns.
716. I'm going to make you a legend in the tabloids. "Billionaire Found in Pieces." It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?
717. You think you can just buy your way out of this? You can't. Because what I want isn't money. It's you. Broken, bleeding, and begging for a mercy that will never come.
718. I'm going to make you a partner in my new venture. It's a company that specializes in making rich people disappear. You're going to be our first client. And our first success story.
719. You think your private jet can take you to safety? I have a friend in the FAA. Your flight plan has just been... altered. You're not going to a tropical paradise. You're going to a watery grave.
720. I'm going to make you a lesson for your children. A lesson in what happens when a man's greed outweighs his sense. They will learn from your mistakes. And they will inherit your fortune.
721. We are the cleansing fire, sent to purge the world of your kind. The day of judgment is upon us, and you have been found wanting. Your flesh will fuel the pyres of our new dawn.
722. You are a blight upon the sacred soil of this nation. We are the holy warriors who will cut you out. Prepare for your martyrdom, for your death will serve a greater purpose than your life ever did.
723. The prophecy has foretold your doom. It is written in the ancient texts. You cannot escape your fate. I am merely the instrument of a power far greater than you can imagine.
724. You have been excommunicated from the human race. You are no longer one of us. You are an abomination, a demon in human form. And we will perform the exorcism. With steel and fire.
725. We are the harbingers of the apocalypse. The riders of the storm. And we have come to usher in the end of your wicked world. Your cities will burn, your towers will fall, and your people will scream our names.
726. You are a sheep, and we are the wolves. You have grazed peacefully for too long. The time of the slaughter is at hand. We will feast on your fear and drink your blood.
727. We are the children of a forgotten god, a god of vengeance and wrath. And we have come to reclaim this world in his name. Your false idols will be shattered, and your priests will be flayed alive.
728. You are a cancer on the soul of our people. A corrupting influence that must be eradicated. We are the surgeons, and our knives are sharp. The operation will be bloody, but the patient will be saved.
729. We are the chosen few, the enlightened, the pure. You are the unwashed masses, the ignorant, the defiled. The great culling is about to begin, and you will be the first to be thinned from the herd.
730. We are the true inheritors of this earth. You are merely squatters, living on borrowed time. The lease is up. And we have come to evict you. Forcibly.
731. You are a dissonant chord in the music of the spheres. A jarring note that disrupts the cosmic harmony. We are the conductors, and we will silence you, so that the true music can be heard.
732. We are the immune system of the planet. And you are the virus that has been making it sick. We have been activated. And we will not stop until every last trace of you has been wiped out.
733. You are a weed in the garden of humanity. You have been allowed to grow for too long, choking out the beautiful flowers. We are the gardeners, and we have come to pull you up by the roots.
734. We are the disciples of a new faith. A faith of blood and iron. And you are the heretic who must be burned at the stake. Your screams will be a hymn to our new god.
735. You are a broken cog in the great machine of progress. You are slowing it down, grinding it to a halt. We are the mechanics, and we are here to replace you. Your parts will be melted down and repurposed.
736. We are the agents of a cosmic justice. A justice that is blind to your pleas, deaf to your excuses, and indifferent to your pain. Your sentence has been passed. And there is no appeal.
737. You are a shadow in a world that craves the light. A darkness that must be banished. We are the bringers of the dawn. And our light will be the fire that consumes you.
738. We are the next step in evolution. A superior breed of human, destined to rule. You are a relic of the past, a dinosaur waiting for the meteor. And we are that meteor.
739. You are a glitch in the matrix. An anomaly that must be corrected. We are the agents of the system, and we have come to delete you. Your reality is about to be rewritten.
740. We are the inevitable. The culmination of history. The final answer to the human question. And you are on the wrong side of that answer.
741. u better stop. just stop. u know what u did. and u know i know. im not gonna warn u again. next time i see u i'm just gonna act. and u aint gonna like it.
742. people like you make me sick. you walk around like you own the place. but you dont. this is my world. and in my world, people like you get put in their place. hard.
743. im watching you. from my window. i see you in your yard. with your kids. they look so happy. it'd be a shame if their daddy had a little accident. a very painful little accident.
744. you think im playing? you think this is some kind of joke? im gonna show you what a joke is. it's what's left of your face after i get done with it.
745. i got your address. i got your picture. i got a whole lot of anger. and i got a full tank of gas. im on my way. you better hope the cops get there first.
746. im gonna find you. i dont care how long it takes. i got nothing but time. and when i find you, im gonna make you wish you had never been born. i promise you that.
747. you took everything from me. my job. my wife. my life. now im gonna take everything from you. starting with your teeth.
748. im not a violent person. but you're pushing me. you're pushing me to a place where i might do something i regret. but you'll regret it more.
749. i hope you have good insurance. because you're gonna need it. im gonna put you in the hospital for a very long time. if you're lucky.
750. i'm going to be the last thing you see. the last thing you hear. the last thing you feel. and it's not going to be pleasant.
751. Keep pushing me. I dare you. You think you know what I'm capable of? You have no idea. You're playing with a fire that will consume you whole.
752. I have a very long memory. And you just made a permanent entry in it. I'm going to file this away, and one day, when you least expect it, I'm going to cash it in. With interest.
753. You have a beautiful family. It would be a tragedy if they were to get caught in the crossfire of a war they didn't even know they were a part of. A war that you started.
754. I'm not going to threaten you. I'm going to give you a piece of advice. Start looking over your shoulder. Because one of these days, you're going to see me there. And it will be too late.
755. You're a very smart person. I'm sure you can calculate the odds of something... unfortunate... happening to you in the near future. I'd say they're pretty high. And climbing.
756. I'm a patient man. I can wait. I can watch you build your life up, brick by brick. And then, when you're at the very top, I'm going to be the one to kick the foundations out from under you.
757. You have a choice. You can either make this right, or you can find out what happens when you make an enemy of me. I suggest you choose wisely. Your future depends on it.
758. I'm not going to get my hands dirty. I have people for that. People who are very good at their jobs. People who can make a problem... disappear. And right now, you are a very big problem.
759. You think you've won? This isn't over. This is just the beginning. I'm going to be the pebble in your shoe, the thorn in your side, the constant, nagging reminder of your mistake. Until I'm not.
760. I want you to think about me. Every day. Every time you lock your door at night. Every time you start your car in the morning. I want you to wonder if today is the day. And one day, it will be.
761. That "promotion" you just got? It comes with a new responsibility: looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. Someone isn't happy about your success, and they plan to correct the situation.
762. The next time you decide to badmouth me to our mutual friends, consider this: reputations are fragile things, but kneecaps are even more so. It would be a shame if yours were to suddenly break.
763. I noticed you haven't been sleeping well. The new security cameras must not be giving you the peace of mind you'd hoped for. Don't worry, when I decide to visit, you won't see me on any camera. You'll just feel my presence.
764. The police report will say it was a tragic accident. Faulty wiring, a terrible fire. Only you and I will know the truth. That you should have paid the insurance I offered you. The protection money.
765. I'm going to make you a deal. You walk away from this deal, forget you ever heard of it, and I'll let you keep your teeth. You try to move forward, and I'll have them pulled, one by one, without anesthetic.
766. You think because I'm behind bars I can't touch you? I have more reach in here than you do out there. I'm going to make one phone call, and your entire world is going to crumble. Your family is first on the list.
767. That cute little coffee shop you love so much? I've been there. I watched you. I even know your order. Next time, I might just add a little something extra to it. Something that will make you very, very sick.
768. I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to do something much worse. I'm going to take away your hope. I will systematically destroy every good thing in your life until all you have left is despair.
769. Your children are so talented. The way your daughter plays the piano is just angelic. It would be a tragedy if she had an accident that damaged her hands permanently. A real tragedy. You can prevent it.
770. You will be found floating in the harbor. The police will call it a suicide. They'll find the note I'm going to type for you. It will be very convincing, detailing your "depression" and "regret."
771. I am going to make you a pariah in your own community. I will spread rumors so vile, so believable, that no one will speak to you, no one will look at you. You will be utterly alone, a leper in your own town.
7_72. The next time you get on a plane, you should pray. Pray that I haven't paid off a mechanic to "forget" a crucial safety check. Flying is so dangerous these days, isn't it?
773. I'm going to make you question your own sanity. I will move things in your house, whisper your name in the night, send you cryptic messages from unknown numbers. You'll be in a padded cell before you know it.
774. Your precious little startup is built on a foundation of lies. And I have the proof. I'm going to leak it to the press, and I'm going to watch your dream burn to the ground. Unless you make me a partner.
775. I'm going to frame you for a crime you didn't commit. Something so awful that you'll be locked away for the rest of your life. And I'll be there at the trial, a character witness, telling them what a monster you are.
776. That inheritance you're so excited about? I'm going to make sure you never see a penny of it. I'll tie it up in legal battles for so long that you'll be dead before it's settled.
777. I'm going to take your face. Not literally, of course. I'm going to use your identity to commit horrible crimes. Your name will be a curse, and your face will be on every wanted poster.
778. You think that restraining order is a shield? It's a target. It tells me exactly how to get to you. It tells me you're afraid. And that makes this so much more fun.
779. I'm going to make you allergic to the world. I know a chemist who can create a substance that will trigger a severe allergic reaction to sunlight. You'll be a creature of the dark, just like me.
780. I will not rest until I have seen you crawl. You will beg me for forgiveness, you will kiss my feet, you will offer me everything you have. And I will laugh, and I will take it all, and then I will destroy you anyway.
781. The time for talk is over. The time for action is now. We are coming. We are legion. And we will not be stopped. This is not a threat. This is a promise.
782. You will be made an example of. Your fate will be a lesson to all who would dare to defy us. It will be a lesson written in blood and bone.
783. We are the architects of a new world order. And you are a relic of the old one. And like all relics, you belong in a museum. Or a grave.
784. The revolution will not be televised. It will be live. And it will be happening in your front yard. Very soon.
785. We are the antibodies of a sick society. And you are the disease. We have come to cleanse you.
786. You are a dead man walking. You just haven't had the decency to lie down yet. We are here to help you with that.
787. We are the storm that is gathering on the horizon. And you are the house of cards that is about to be blown away.
788. You have been weighed. You have been measured. And you have been found wanting. The sentence is death.
789. We are the harbingers of your doom. The bringers of your end. The reapers of your soul. And we have come to collect.
790. You are a weed in the garden of our glorious nation. And we are the gardeners. We have come to pull you up by the roots.
791. We are the wolves at your door. And we are very, very hungry.
792. You are a footnote in the history that we are about to write. A footnote that will be erased.
793. We are the final solution to the problem of you.
794. You are a sacrifice that must be made for the greater good. Your death will serve a purpose. Our purpose.
795. We are the future. And you are the past. And there is no room for you in the world we are building.
796. You are a bug that we are about to squash.
797. We are the justice that you have been denied. And our justice is swift, and it is final.
798. You are a lesson that we are about to teach. A lesson that will be remembered for a very long time.
799. We are the end of your world. And the beginning of ours.
800. You are a memory that we are about to erase.
801. I'm going to make sure that every time you close your eyes, you see my face. I will be the star of your nightmares, the monster that lives in your head. Sleep will be a terror, not a refuge.
802. Your new address is not a secret. I've been by the house. It's a nice place. Too bad the fire insurance policies don't cover "acts of God," and I'm feeling particularly divine today.
803. I'm going to befriend your father. We'll go fishing, we'll talk about our kids. He'll love me. And when he trusts me completely, I'll tell him all about your little... secret. The one that would break his heart.
804. I will take your voice, but not your life. I'll make it so you can never speak, sing, or scream again. You'll be trapped in a prison of silence, with only your thoughts for company. And they will all be of me.
805. You will receive a small box in the mail. Inside, you'll find a single tooth. Don't worry, it's not yours. It belongs to someone you love. And there are many more where that came from. Comply, or the next box will be heavier.
806. I'm going to make you a celebrity. I'll create a website dedicated to you. It will have your address, your phone number, your daily schedule, and a list of all the reasons why people should hate you. The internet can be a very angry mob.
807. We're going to play a little game. I'm going to hide one of your children. If you can find them in 24 hours, you can keep them. If not, they're mine. The clock starts now.
808. I'm not going to touch you. I'm going to touch everyone you love. I will bring ruin and misery to your friends, your family, your colleagues. You will be a walking plague, and everyone you care about will suffer for your sins.
809. I'm going to make you a believer. I'm going to commit a series of "miracles" in your life. Miracles of pain, miracles of loss, miracles of terror. You will pray to me to make it stop. And I will not answer.
810. You will be found in a hotel room, a victim of a "drug overdose." The needle will be in your arm, the spoon on the table. The police will close the case in a day. No one will know that I was the one who administered the dose.
811. I am going to turn your own blood against you. I will convince your son that you are the source of all his problems. I will arm him with a gun and a grievance. And I will watch as he becomes the instrument of my revenge.
812. I will not kill you. I will give you an incurable disease. Something that will slowly, painfully, eat you from the inside out. You will have years to contemplate your mistake, as your body betrays you.
813. I'm going to make you a ghost in your own life. I'll erase your digital footprint, cancel your credit cards, report you as a missing person. You will cease to exist on paper. A living phantom with no name and no home.
814. I will be the last customer at your restaurant tonight. And after I'm done with my meal, I'm going to lock the doors and set the place on fire. You and your staff will be my a la carte dessert.
815. I'm going to make you a work of public art. I'll hang you from a lamppost in the center of town, with a sign around your neck detailing your crimes. You will be a warning to all the other corrupt officials.
816. You think you're safe in the witness protection program? I have a friend on the inside. He just sold me your new name, your new address, and your new life. See you soon, "Mr. Smith."
817. I'm going to make you a prisoner in a virtual world. I'll trap you in a VR simulation of your worst fears, and I'll make it so you can never log out. Your mind will be my playground.
818. I will take your memories. I'll use a combination of drugs and electroshock therapy to wipe your mind clean. You will be a blank slate, with no past, no identity, no one to come looking for you.
819. I'm going to make you a ticking time bomb. I'll implant a small explosive device in your body, with a remote detonator. You will do exactly as I say, or I will push a button and you will be nothing but a red mist.
820. I will not just kill you. I will kill your legacy. I will burn your books, destroy your art, slander your name. I will make it so that you are remembered for nothing but the infamy of your death at my hands.
821. I am the shadow that walks behind you, the chill on the back of your neck. You can't see me, but you can feel me. And I am always there. Waiting.
822. Your comfortable little life is a house of cards. And I am the gentle breeze that is about to bring it all tumbling down.
823. I'm not going to make a scene. I'm just going to quietly, methodically, dismantle your life. You won't even realize what's happening until you're standing in the ruins, wondering where it all went wrong.
824. You have something that belongs to me. And I am going to take it back. I don't care who gets in my way. I don't care what I have to do. It's mine.
825. I am the consequence you never thought you'd have to face. The bill that has finally come due. And you don't have enough to pay.
826. I'm not going to threaten your life. I'm going to threaten your lifestyle. Everything you've worked for, everything you value, everything you love. It's all on the table.
827. You have a choice. You can either give me what I want, or I can take it. And trust me, you'd rather give it to me.
828. I am the ghost of a promise you broke. And I have come to collect. With interest.
829. You think you're safe? You're not. You're just living on borrowed time. And the loan is about to be called in.
830. I'm going to be the silent partner in every decision you make from now on. And if you make the wrong decision, I'll be the one to correct it. Painfully.
831. You are a loose thread. And I am the one who is going to pull on it, until your whole world unravels.
832. I'm not going to be your enemy. I'm going to be your worst nightmare. The one you can't wake up from.
833. You have a debt to pay. And I am the collector. And my methods are very... persuasive.
834. I'm not going to lay a hand on you. I'm going to make you do it to yourself. I will drive you to such a state of despair that you will see no other way out.
835. You are a ship, sailing on a calm sea. And I am the iceberg, hidden beneath the surface. And you are on a collision course.
836. I'm going to be the last thing on your mind. Not because I'm going to kill you. But because I'm going to make your life so unbearable that you'll have no room for any other thoughts.
837. You have built your life on a foundation of sand. And I am the tide that is coming in.
838. I'm not going to be a storm. I'm going to be a drought. I will slowly, patiently, drain the life out of everything you hold dear.
839. You are a star, shining brightly in the night sky. And I am the black hole that is going to swallow you whole.
840. I'm going to be the poison in your well. A single drop that will contaminate everything you touch, everything you are.
841. This country is sick. And you are the disease. We are the surgeons who will cut you out. The operation will be messy, but necessary.
842. The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. We are the patriots. You are the tyrant. The time for watering is at hand.
843. You are a traitor to your race. You have betrayed your own people for a handful of silver. We are the ones who will make you pay the price. And it will be a price paid in blood.
844. We are the true sons of this soil. And you are an interloper, a parasite. We will burn you out, and reclaim our land.
845. You have been found guilty of crimes against the people. The sentence is death. A people's tribunal has spoken. And their word is law.
846. We are the ghosts of the soldiers you sent to die in your pointless wars. And we have come back for you. We will drag you down to the hell you created for us.
847. You are a puppet of the globalist elite. And we are the ones who will cut your strings. And then we will come for the puppet masters.
88. We are the righteous anger of a wronged people. We are the storm that will sweep you from power. We are the revolution that will devour its own. And you are on the menu.
849. You are a symbol of the corruption that has rotted this nation to its core. And we are the ones who will tear that symbol down, and grind it into the dust.
850. We are the ones who have been forgotten. The ones who have been left behind. And we have nothing left to lose. Which makes us very, very dangerous. To you.
851. You are a sheep, and we are the shepherds who have come to lead you to the slaughter.
852. We are the alpha and the omega of your pathetic little existence. The beginning of your end.
853. You are a cancer that we will cure with a bullet.
854. We are the ones your parents warned you about. And we are all grown up now.
855. You are a pawn in a game you don't understand. And you are about to be sacrificed.
856. We are the nightmare from which you will never awake.
857. You are a rat in our maze. And at the end of it, there is no cheese. Only a trap.
858. We are the sound of your own heart, beating in your ears, just before it stops.
859. You are a dead man, you just don't have the courtesy to lie down and die. We will help you with that.
860. We are the future. And you are not in it.
861. You have 48 hours to transfer the 10 Bitcoin to the specified wallet. Failure to comply will result in the immediate and permanent deletion of all your company's data, including backups. We are not bluffing.
862. I have gained access to your entire email history. It's fascinating reading. I'm sure your wife would find the correspondence with "Candy" particularly interesting. Do as I say, or she gets a full transcript.
863. The security on your smart home is a joke. I can control your lights, your locks, your thermostat. I can even watch you through your own cameras. I own you. Now, let's talk about my fee.
864. I've placed a keylogger on your computer. I have every password, every credit card number, every private message you've ever typed. Your digital life is in my hands. And I'm not a gentle person.
865. I've created a deepfake video of you. It's very convincing. It shows you doing things... terrible things. I'm sending it to the police, the press, and your mother in one hour. Unless you pay me.
866. I've hacked into the DMV database. I have your address, your photo, your signature. I'm going to use your identity to commit a series of crimes that will land you in prison for the rest of your life.
867. I've breached your company's network and stolen your entire customer list. I'm going to sell it on the dark web to the highest bidder. The damage to your reputation will be catastrophic. Unless you meet my price.
868. I have control of your car's onboard computer. I can disable your brakes, your steering, your airbags. The next time you go for a drive, it might be your last. Think about that before you refuse my offer.
869. I'm going to launch a DDoS attack on your website that will knock it offline for weeks. Every minute of downtime will cost you thousands of dollars. It would be so much cheaper to just pay me.
870. I have your daughter's cell phone number. I'm going to start sending her messages. Creepy messages. From you. I've spoofed your number. She'll think her own father is a monster. Unless you cooperate.
871. I've installed ransomware on your hospital's network. All your patient records are encrypted. You can't perform surgeries, you can't dispense medication. People will die. And it will be your fault. Unless you pay.
872. I'm going to use your social media accounts to destroy your life. I'll post things that will get you fired, get you arrested, get you ostracized from everyone you know. I will turn your life into a living hell.
873. I have access to your bank accounts. I'm not going to steal your money. I'm going to donate it all to terrorist organizations. You'll be on every watch list in the world. Have fun explaining that to the FBI.
874. I've hacked your online trading account. I'm going to make a series of disastrous trades that will wipe out your life savings in a matter of minutes. Or, you could just give me a small percentage of it.
875. I've gained access to the nation's power grid. I can cause blackouts at will. I can shut down cities. I can create chaos. And I will, unless my demands are met. The ball is in your court, Mr. President.
876. I have your browsing history. All of it. The "incognito" mode is not as private as you think. It's a treasure trove of filth. And I'm going to share it with the world.
877. I'm going to swat you. I'm going to call the police and tell them you're a heavily armed madman with a house full of hostages. The SWAT team doesn't usually knock. I hope you're a sound sleeper.
878. I've cloned your credit cards. I'm going on a shopping spree. I'm going to buy things you can't afford, in places you've never been. You'll be in debt for the rest of your life.
879. I have control of your pacemaker. I can speed it up, slow it down, or just turn it off. Your life is literally in my hands. And I'm not a very forgiving person.
880. I'm going to make you a digital ghost. I will erase every trace of your existence online. You will have no social media, no bank accounts, no email. You will be a non-person in a digital world.
881. You think because you fired me I'm gone? I planted a logic bomb in the company's mainframe before I left. In three days, it's going to wipe every single file. Have fun rebuilding from scratch, you backstabbing piece of trash.
882. I know you've been seeing him. Don't lie to me. I've seen the texts. I'm going to find him, and I'm going to hurt him. Badly. And I'm going to make you watch. Then you'll know what it feels like to be betrayed.
883. That was my parking spot. You saw me waiting. But you just swooped in and took it. I'm going to wait until you go into the store, and then I'm going to key your car from bumper to bumper. People need to learn some respect.
884. You gave my son a C on his history paper? He worked so hard on that. You've ruined his chances of getting into a good college. I'm going to make you understand what it feels like to have your future taken away from you.
885. Stop letting your dog poop on my lawn. I'm not going to ask you again. The next time it happens, I'm going to collect it, and I'm going to smear it all over your front door.
886. You think you can just ignore my emails? I'm not some spammer you can just delete. I'm a person. A person you have wronged. And I will not be ignored. I will find you. And I will make you listen.
887. You're a snake. You smiled to my face while you were stabbing me in the back. But I'm not going to play your game. I'm going to come at you head-on. And you're not going to see it coming.
888. I'm going to make you a deal. You apologize, publicly, for what you said about me. Or I'm going to make it my life's mission to destroy you. Your choice.
889. You think you're better than me? With your fancy car and your big house? You're nothing. And I'm going to prove it. I'm going to take everything from you, just to show you that you're no better than me.
890. I'm not crazy. I'm just angry. Very, very angry. And you are the focus of all my rage. You should be scared. You should be very, very scared.
891. You think this is over? This is far from over. This is just the intermission. The second act is about to begin, and it's going to be a bloodbath.
892. I'm going to be the karma that you've been so desperately trying to avoid. And trust me, I'm a bitch.
893. You're going to pay for what you did. Not with money. With fear. I'm going to make you so afraid that you'll wish you were dead.
894. I'm going to haunt you. Not as a ghost. As a living, breathing reminder of your failure.
895. You're going to regret the day you ever met me. I'm going to make sure of it.
896. I'm going to make your life a living hell. And I'm going to enjoy every minute of it.
897. You're going to wish you had just done what I asked. It would have been so much easier for you. But you had to be difficult. And now you're going to pay the price.
898. I'm going to be your shadow. Your constant companion. The one you can't get rid of. The one who knows all your secrets.
899. You're going to learn a lesson in respect. And I'm going to be the teacher. And my methods are very... hands-on.
900. You've made a very powerful enemy today. And I don't forgive. And I don't forget.
901. The vessel is prepared. The blood moon is rising. Your name has been spoken in the old tongue. The ritual requires a sacrifice, and you have been chosen. Do not fight it. Your end will bring about a new beginning.
902. I've been studying the schematics of the dam above your town. It's old, poorly maintained. A few well-placed charges, and a wall of water will wash away all the sin. Including you.
903. The child you're carrying is an abomination. It must not be born. I will be the one to perform the... procedure. It will be a mercy. For you, and for the world.
904. We are the final generation. We have seen the truth. The world must be cleansed of the old and the weak. We will start with you, and your "family." You are the past. We are the future.
905. I have synthesized a new airborne prion disease. It is highly contagious, and 100% fatal. I will release it at the international summit you are attending next week. The leaders of the world will fall, and a new order will rise from the ashes.
906. You will be taken to a black site. There are no laws there. No human rights. Just me, you, and my instruments. I'm going to peel back the layers of your mind until I find what I'm looking for.
907. I'm going to make you a living organ farm. I'll keep you alive, barely, and harvest your organs one by one, selling them on the black market. You'll die a slow, piecemeal death.
908. We have planted a dirty bomb in the heart of your city. It will detonate in 24 hours, rendering the downtown core uninhabitable for a thousand years. Unless our demands are met. The choice is yours.
909. I will not kill you. I will kill the idea of you. I will erase you from history. I will destroy every record, every photo, every memory of your existence. You will be a ghost, a void, a nothing.
910. I'm going to make you a player in a game of my own design. The prize is your life. The obstacles are your loved ones. To win, you must be willing to sacrifice them all. Are you ready to play?
911. I have your daughter. She is safe. For now. You will follow my instructions to the letter. Any deviation, any attempt to contact the police, and you will receive her back... in pieces.
912. I've been hired to kill you. But I'm a professional, not a monster. I'm going to give you a 24-hour head start. If you can disappear, truly disappear, I'll let you live. If I find you, I'll do my job.
913. I'm going to make you a Judas. I will put you in a position where you have to choose between your own life and the lives of a hundred innocent people. And I will watch you make the selfish choice. And then I will kill you anyway.
914. I've created a new, self-replicating computer virus. It's designed to target financial institutions. In 12 hours, I will unleash it, and the world economy will collapse. Unless you give me what I want.
915. I will make you a god. I will upload your consciousness to the cloud, where you will live forever as a disembodied intelligence. The only catch is, I will be the one who controls your world. And I am not a benevolent god.
916. I'm going to make you a paradox. I will send a team back in time to kill your parents before you were born. You will simply cease to have ever existed. A ripple in the fabric of time, smoothed over and forgotten.
917. I have a swarm of nanobots. They are undetectable, and they can be programmed to do anything. I'm going to inject them into your bloodstream. They will lie dormant, until I give the command. And then they will eat you from the inside out.
918. I'm going to make you the patient zero of a global pandemic. I'll infect you with a genetically engineered virus, and then I'll release you into a crowded airport. You will be the harbinger of a new dark age.
919. I will not just take your life. I will take your soul. I have studied the dark arts. I will bind your spirit to my will. You will serve me, even in death.
920. I'm going to make you a star. Literally. I have a friend at a private space exploration company. We're going to launch you into the sun. Your death will be a brief, beautiful, and utterly silent spectacle.
921. You've been a thorn in my side for too long. I'm not going to play games anymore. I'm coming for you. And I'm going to bring a world of pain with me.
922. I'm going to make you a public spectacle of humiliation. I'm going to strip you naked, physically and metaphorically, in front of the entire world. You will be a laughingstock, a cautionary tale of hubris.
923. I'm going to make you an offer you can't survive.
924. I'm going to make you a memory that tastes like ash in the mouths of those who loved you.
925. I'm going to make you a ghost in the machine, a silent, screaming passenger in your own hijacked life.
926. I'm going to make you a symphony of suffering, and I will be the conductor, my baton a blade, your screams the music.
927. I'm going to make you a question that has no answer, a void in the space where a person used to be.
928. I'm going to make you a rumor whispered in dark alleys, a story that ends with "and they were never seen again."
929. I'm going to make you a scar on the face of your family's history, a mark of shame that will never fade.
930. I'm going to make you a footnote in my biography, a minor character in the story of my rise to power.
931. I'm going to make you a key that unlocks my full potential. Your destruction is the final component I need.
932. I'm going to make you a river of tears that flows from the eyes of everyone you've ever known.
933. I'm going to make you a promise that I will break. The promise that you will live to see tomorrow.
934. I'm going to make you a religion, and your suffering will be the holy text. I will be your only god, and your only devil.
935. I'm going to make you a compass that points only to your own doom. Every path you take will lead you back to me.
936. I'm going to make you a mirror that reflects only my own twisted image. You will lose yourself in my reflection.
937. I'm going to make you a cage, and your own mind will be the bars. You will be your own jailer, and I will be the one who holds the key.
938. I'm going to make you a stone that I will throw into the pond of your life. The ripples will spread, and they will drown everyone you love.
939. I'm going to make you a seed of doubt that I will plant in the minds of your allies. It will grow into a tree of paranoia, and its roots will tear your world apart.
940. I'm going to make you a masterpiece of pain, a work of art so terrible and so beautiful that it will be spoken of for generations.
941. That's a lovely painting. It would be a shame if someone were to... improve it. With a splash of red. A very specific shade of red.
942. You seem to be under the impression that you have a choice in this matter. Let me correct that misconception. Your only choice is whether you walk out of here, or get carried out.
943. I'm not going to say what will happen if you don't comply. I'm just going to let your imagination do the work. And I have a feeling your imagination is very, very good.
944. You have a bright future ahead of you. It would be a tragedy if it were to be... cut short. By an unforeseen... complication.
945. I'm not a violent man. But I know people who are. People who owe me favors. People who would be very happy to... persuade you to see things my way.
946. You know, accidents happen all the time. Brakes fail. People fall down stairs. It's a dangerous world. It would be wise to have a powerful friend watching your back. A friend like me.
947. I'm not making a threat. I'm stating a fact. If you continue on this path, you will end up in a very bad place. A place from which there is no return.
948. You have a lovely voice. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it. Something that would make it very difficult for you to... sing your little songs of defiance.
949. I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'm just going to lay out the options. On one hand, you have a long and prosperous life. On the other hand, you have... the alternative.
950. You're a brave person. I'll give you that. But bravery and stupidity are often two sides of the same coin. And I think you're about to find out which side your coin has landed on.
951. I have a problem. And you are the solution. The only question is whether you will be a willing solution, or an unwilling one.
952. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm just going to take something you love. Something you can't live without. And I'm not going to give it back until you do what I say.
953. You have a guardian angel. It's me. And I'm about to take a vacation. I'd advise you to make things right before I go.
954. I'm not going to leave a mark on you. The scars I leave will be on the inside. The kind that never heal.
955. You're at a crossroads. One path leads to safety and security. The other path leads to... me. Choose wisely.
956. I'm not going to be the one who pulls the trigger. I'm going to be the one who hands you the gun and convinces you that it's the only way out.
957. You have a secret. A dirty little secret. And I know what it is. And I'm going to tell everyone. Unless you make it worth my while to keep it quiet.
958. I'm not going to be your downfall. I'm going to be the one who watches you fall, and then steps on your fingers as you're trying to climb back up.
959. You're a fly, caught in my web. The more you struggle, the more entangled you become. Just relax. It will be over soon.
960. I'm not going to be your judge and jury. I'm going to be your executioner. And the verdict has already been decided.
961. The day you crossed me was the day you cashed in your life insurance policy. And I am the beneficiary. I'm coming to collect.
962. I'm going to make you a ghost in your own life. You'll be there, but no one will see you. You'll scream, but no one will hear you. You'll be a prisoner in a world of your own making, and I will be the warden.
963. I will be the architect of your ruin. I will build a cathedral of your suffering, and your screams will be the hymns that echo in its halls.
964. You are a candle, and I am the hurricane. I will not just extinguish you. I will shatter the very candlestick you stand on.
965. I'm going to turn your own blood into poison. I will make your family see you as a monster, a traitor, a thing to be feared and destroyed. They will be the ones to tear you apart.
966. I will not give you the mercy of a quick death. I will give you the curse of a long life, a life filled with nothing but pain, loss, and the ever-present memory of my face.
967. I am going to peel the skin from the world you know, and show you the writhing, maggot-infested reality that lies beneath. Your sanity will be the first casualty.
968. I will be the silence that falls after a scream, the chilling void where hope used to be. Your world will be a vacuum, and I will be the one who sucked all the air out.
969. I'm going to make you a player in a game where all the rules are written in a language you don't understand, and every move you make is the wrong one. The only way to win is not to play, but you're already at the table.
970. I will not break your bones. I will break the promises that hold your world together. I will turn your love to hate, your trust to suspicion, your faith to despair. You will be a king of a kingdom of ashes.
971. I am going to take your name and forge it into a weapon. A weapon that will be used to destroy everything you hold dear. Your own identity will be the instrument of your doom.
972. I will be the echo of your own laughter, twisted into a sound of pure mockery. Every happy memory you have will be corrupted, until your past is a gallery of grotesques.
973. I'm going to make you a prisoner of hope. I will give you a glimpse of a way out, a sliver of light in the darkness. And then I will snatch it away. Over and over again, until hope itself becomes a form of torture.
974. I will be the rust that eats away at the chains of your sanity. A slow, inexorable decay that will leave you a gibbering wreck, adrift in a sea of madness.
975. I'm going to make you a star in a constellation of my own design. A constellation of all the people who have crossed me. You'll be in good company. But you'll be very, very far from home.
976. I will be the whisper that starts an avalanche of ruin in your life. A single word, a single doubt, that will grow until it buries you.
977. I'm going to make you a beautiful, tragic poem. A poem written in the language of pain, with stanzas of sorrow and a final, bloody couplet.
978. I will be the gravity that pulls you down into the abyss. You can fight it, you can struggle, but in the end, you will fall. And I will be waiting for you at the bottom.
979. I'm going to make you a puzzle with a missing piece. The missing piece will be your soul. And you will spend the rest of eternity searching for it, in a hell of my own design.
980. I will be the silence in your music, the empty space in your art, the void in your heart. I will be the absence that defines you.
981. You think you're safe behind that badge? I'm going to make you a cautionary tale for every cop in this city. A story of what happens when you stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
982. I'm going to make you a hero. I'm going to kill you in a way that makes it look like you died in the line of duty. Your family will get a folded flag and a pension. And I'll get away with murder.
983. I know your patrol route. I know your shift changes. I know where you stop for coffee. And one of these days, you're not going to make it back to the station.
984. I'm going to frame you for police brutality. I'll find a minority, pay him to provoke you, and have my people film you "overreacting." You'll be the next viral video, the next symbol of a broken system.
985. You think your partner has your back? I've been talking to him. He's got a gambling problem. And I
